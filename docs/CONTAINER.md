# Running the measurement as a container

The SSH path rents a *machine*: create it, parse the id it answers with, poll
its state, size its disk, find where its filesystem is mounted, upload a
bundle, bootstrap it, and remember to destroy it. Porting that to three clouds
produced **five defects, and not one of them was about the measurement**:

| defect | what it cost |
|---|---|
| machine ids that are not integers | crashed *after* the pod existed — twice — leaving a billing instance unadopted |
| the running state spelled `"Running"` vs `"RUNNING"` | two healthy polls read as a preemption; a box torn down mid-bootstrap |
| those ids compared as ints inside a set | the "is it really gone?" check would report a **live** instance destroyed |
| storage sized 100 GB | correct only where the disk is separable; `No space left on device`, 45 min into a paid run |
| three hardcoded `/home/jl_fs` roots | the worst stalled an A100 at **0% GPU for two hours** at $1.59/h — $3.07 before anyone noticed |

An image removes some environment/layout variation; it does not remove the
provider's instance ids, lifecycle, disk sizing, billing or cleanup duties.
The caller must still provision storage and supervise the container host.

**The SSH path is not removed.** JarvisLabs is driven through its own CLI and
has no custom-image path at all, and a new transport proves itself before it
replaces a working one. `bin/measure-cloud` is unchanged in behaviour.

**Evidence scope, 2026-09-07:** the Lambda A10-equipped host/image acceptance
test below ran its fixture forwards on **CPU**. The later Fruit L4 GPU
reproduction is separate evidence. Neither install/import success nor setup
decode parity qualifies all model forwards, GPU models or drivers.

---

## What is in the image

`bin/bootstrap_measure.sh` is the specification, and the Dockerfile **runs that
script** rather than paraphrasing it — so there is exactly one definition of
the environment and the image cannot drift from it. `bin/selftest_container.py`
rung C9 fails the build if the Dockerfile ever grows its own `pip install
torch`.

| baked | why |
|---|---|
| `python3.12` on plain `ubuntu:24.04` | the proven env recipe is py3.12-only, and the bootstrap asserts it. Deliberately **not** a vendor pytorch template: the RunPod one ships torch *without* numpy and its system python is PEP 668 externally-managed, which killed two runs |
| the pinned wheel set (`torch==2.11.0+cu130`, `transformers==5.16.1`, …) | reproducible numbers. torch's cu130 wheels carry their own CUDA userspace; only `libcuda.so` comes from the host |
| the quant pipeline at its pin + patches `0001-0006`, `0008` | the reader bytes every sealed streaming row binds |
| `bin/BUNDLE.txt`'s audited file set | the same list the SSH uploader uses — one list, two transports |
| `/opt/fidelity/BUILD.json` + `image-pin.txt` | what the build actually resolved, and a content digest over it |

What is **not** baked: the run root. `/workspace` is a `VOLUME`, always.
Defaulting it into the image would put a 200 GB fetch on the container's own
layer — the shape of the bug that had a restarted pod skip `setup` as done
while the tree it wrote had evaporated.

Steps 5 and 6 of the bootstrap (the four offline surface batteries) run at
**container start**, not at build: the GGUF battery's rung 1b re-decodes the
committed real bytes on *this box's* CUDA device, and a builder has no GPU.
Running it there would either fail a good build or pass vacuously.

### The image contains no credential

The HF token arrives at runtime — `--token-file`, or `HF_TOKEN` — is written to
`$FS/.secrets/hf_token` 0600, which is the file `stage_measure.sh load_token`
already reads, and is then **removed from the environment the stages see**. It
never reaches argv, which is the property `bin/measure_cloud.py` has and must
keep. Rung C4 asserts all four halves of that.
For the admitted SSH route, publication and download now use separate token
files: `--hf-token-file` stays controller-local; explicit
`--hf-download-token-file` is the pod credential. The generic container
entrypoint's `--token-file`/`HF_TOKEN` interface does not certify read-only
scope or provide a remote-code sandbox. Do not mount a publisher credential
into an untrusted capture environment.

---

## Building

```bash
container/build.sh --tag <registry>/<name>:<tag>
```

It refuses a dirty checkout. `produced_by.revision` is required by the
submission schema and has no "unknown" value — an image built from uncommitted
edits would stamp every receipt with a commit that does not describe its own
bytes. (`--allow-dirty` exists for a throwaway build and says so.)

The build context is ~10 MB: `.dockerignore` excludes everything and lets back
in only the four trees the image needs, then re-excludes the heavy evidence
directories — while re-including the two files inside them that `BUNDLE.txt`
actually lists, because a setup-time selftest opens them fail-closed. Rung C5
checks every bundle entry against those patterns, since an over-eager exclusion
does not fail the build: it produces an image that dies in `setup` on a rented
box.

---

## Driving it

The entrypoint mirrors the CLI and writes the **same `job.json` contract**
`stage_measure.sh` already reads. It does not reimplement a stage:
`bin/stage_measure.sh` owns what a stage does and `bin/fidelity/stages.py` owns
which stages run, and the SSH controller now asks that same module — so the two
transports cannot drift into different sequences.

**`capture` and `measure` are pod-contract verbs, not a human's command line.**
Both require a planner-written `--target-descriptor` (the exact shard census
the controller computes: config/index digests, shard bytes, download manifest —
`bin/selftest_container.py` and `bin/selftest_root_publish.py` show its
shape; no user-facing tool writes one), the three resource minima
(`--workspace-available-bytes-minimum`, `--container-available-bytes-minimum`,
`--expected-vram-bytes`) and a `--gpu` string with an **authored timing row**
in `bin/engines.json`: today `NVIDIA L4` for the Fruit root and `NVIDIA H200`
for GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16 and GLM-5.3-BF16 (`root_timing_profiles`); `measure`
additionally admits only the `tr3-6bpw` / `native-bf16` profiles. Any other
card refuses with `root_timing_evidence_absent` before anything is fetched —
the row exists to cap paid spend, and the entrypoint does not know it is not
on a meter. There is no `--surface`/`--bits` on `measure` (the target
descriptor carries them). Run as written, with `--dry-run`:

```
$ python3 bin/container_entry.py capture --dry-run --model zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16 --revision 304b8051cfb2b260b61ce0cbe330e02a98e73639 \
      --panel-dir /panel --dataset-id fidelity--x.malaiwah.root.bf16 --lane streaming --gpu "NVIDIA A10"
fidelity capture: error: the following arguments are required: --target-descriptor, --workspace-available-bytes-minimum, --container-available-bytes-minimum, --expected-vram-bytes
$ python3 bin/container_entry.py measure --dry-run --model x/y --revision 304b8051cfb2b260b61ce0cbe330e02a98e73639 \
      --profile k6 --panel-descriptor /panel.json --lane streaming
fidelity measure: error: the following arguments are required: --target-descriptor, --gpu, --workspace-available-bytes-minimum, --container-available-bytes-minimum, --expected-vram-bytes
```

What a human at a workstation can drive:

```bash
# what is this image, and what can it see? (needs a writable /workspace)
docker run --gpus all --rm -v /data/run:/workspace <image> doctor
docker run --rm <image> version

# one stage, against a job document a controller already wrote
docker run --gpus all --rm -v /data/run:/workspace <image> stage --job /workspace/fidelity/job.json capture

# the zero-venv LOCAL route: the image's pinned interpreter running the dataset
# tools it ships (fidelity_dataset.py, hf_capture.py, the committed panels).
# Same argv as README Recipe 2 -> Local GPU quickstart; the checkpoint and the
# output live on your mount. Nothing here is a pod contract.
docker run --gpus all --rm -v /nvme:/nvme -e HF_HOME=/nvme/hf \
    --entrypoint /opt/fidelity/venv/bin/python <image> \
    /opt/fidelity/suite/bin/fidelity_dataset.py capture --engine hf-transformers \
        --out /nvme/ds/root-1 --form hidden --role root --lane streaming -- \
        --model /nvme/models/m --model-revision <40-hex> --weights-repository <owner>/<repo> --repository <handle>/<dataset-repo> \
        --panel /opt/fidelity/suite/engines/panels/panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1 \
        --panel-id panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1 --schedule layer-outer --device cuda --dtype bfloat16 \
        --dataset-id fidelity--<family>.<handle>.root.bf16 --dataset-name "<name>" \
        --run-name root-cold-1 --cold-run root-cold-1 --author <handle> --role root --sanity-expect Paris
```

Size it first with `bin/measure-local --artifact <repo> --panel <dataset>
--estimate-only` on the host: GLM-5.3-class captures measured 37.53 GB
allocated / 57.08 GB reserved (bf16, FP8) and 56.86 GB (K4 trellis) on H200 and
are refused below 64 GB; the container adds nothing to that arithmetic. The
container runs as root, so `chown` the mount afterwards (below).

Useful everywhere: `--dry-run` prints the job document and the stage list and
creates nothing; `--job FILE` uses a planner-written document verbatim;
`--only` / `--stop-after` narrow the sequence; `--image-pin <digest>` tells the
run which image the launcher pulled.

## Getting the answer back

A container has no controller holding an SSH connection open, so nothing pulls
`receipts.tar.gz` back the way `measure_cloud.py` does. For a while that was
only half-solved: `--publish-root-to` gave a multi-GB **root capture** a way
home, and the verb this project exists to serve had none. `measure` seals
`receipts/measurement-receipt.json` — 4–40 KB, and *the* object the registry
ingests — and a container-native run ended by naming the path it was written
to, inside a pod-scoped volume on a provider whose REST API
(`/v1/pods`, `/v1/pods/{id}`, `/billing/pods`) serves no logs and no files, in
an image that runs no sshd. The same was true of `stage`, and of a **failed**
run, whose receipts and logs are the evidence you most want and can least often
reach.

So the product is not "a dataset". It is *whatever this run sealed*, and the
caller picks the channel, because only the caller knows what they can read.

```bash
# stdout: always on, needs no flag. The only channel every platform has.
docker run --gpus all --rm -v /data/run:/workspace <image> measure ...

# a second copy onto a mount you control
... <image> measure ... --result-sink file:/workspace/out

# PUT the bundle somewhere you can read: presigned S3/R2/GCS, a collector,
# or an ntfy topic (which you can poll back with ?poll=1)
... <image> measure ... --result-sink https://ntfy.sh/<your-topic>
```

| sink | carries | use it when |
|---|---|---|
| `stdout` (always) | the summary + the receipt inline under 256 KB | any provider whose console or `docker logs` you can read |
| `file:PATH` | receipts + `job.json` + summary | a bind mount or a VM you own (Lambda, your own box) |
| `https://URL` | the same, as `tar.gz`, by **PUT** | automation; the pod cannot read anything back |
| `--publish-root-to` | the sealed **dataset** | a root/preview capture — multi-GB does not belong in a log frame |

Four properties worth stating, because each one is a defect that happened:

* **stdout is unconditional and delivered first.** If a later sink is
  misconfigured or its collector is down, the answer has already been printed.
  A failing sink is reported and **never changes the run's exit code** — the
  measurement either happened or it did not, and a collector being down is not
  a measurement result.
* **Delivery is in the `finally`**, so a run that fails at stage three still
  reports what it has. On RunPod the run root dies with the pod.
* **The HF token is shredded *before* any sink runs**, and `.secrets/` and the
  multi-GB `.stream-work/` scratch tree are excluded from every bundle.
* **A sink URL is often itself the credential** (a presigned PUT), so it is
  registered for redaction, `FIDELITY_RESULT_SINK` is the preferred channel —
  providers echo `dockerArgs` back in their consoles and API listings, and
  environment variables they do not — and a failure names the host and path
  but never the query string.

The frame is greppable on purpose:

```
===== FIDELITY-RESULT BEGIN =====
{ "schema": "malaiwah.fidelity-result-summary.v1", "verb": "measure",
  "status": "ok", "files": [ {"path": "...", "sha256": "..."} ] }
----- measurement-receipt.json -----
{ ... }
===== FIDELITY-RESULT END =====
```

Over the 256 KB cap the receipt is **withheld rather than dumped** — the frame
still carries its sha256, so the artifact stays identifiable and the summary
does not get pushed out of a provider's log buffer by bytes nobody can use in
that form.

---

### What it refuses rather than guesses

`measure` without `--profile` is refused, naming
`bin/engines.json`'s `profile_map_by_surface` as the remedy. The cloud planner
resolves that from the *sniffed* surface and bit rate; in a container nothing
sniffs, and guessing is not the smaller failure — `k6` is a real profile naming
a real receipt family, so a wrong guess publishes a wrong label instead of
crashing. Use `--job` to carry a planner-resolved document.

### Resuming

Unchanged: every stage writes a `.done` marker under `$FS/receipts/done`, and a
capture whose dataset already exists is skipped. Re-running the same command
against the same mount resumes; the suite is re-synced into the mount by digest,
so a second start copies nothing.

---

## The container reproduced a published root, bitwise

On 2026-08-31 the image captured `malaiwah/GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit-bf16` on a RunPod
L4 — container-native, no SSH, no bundle upload, the panel read from inside the
image — and published it to
[`malaiwah/fruit-fidelity-root-container-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/fruit-fidelity-root-container-v1).

```
capture_content_digest  b417acc22b8aa7f3294b8e62c4b619bc5051aef9fd8a073602572a30af6b3e1c   container
                        b417acc22b8aa7f3294b8e62c4b619bc5051aef9fd8a073602572a30af6b3e1c   published root
```

Identical, and so is every field of the stack fingerprint — torch 2.11.0+cu130,
transformers 5.16.1, CUDA 13.0, `NVIDIA L4`, `transformers-eager`, default
matmul precision. The L4 was chosen to match the published root's device.
The architecture study found matching bits in particular paired rentals,
not that GPU model alone exhausts all host/driver/kernel effects. This is a
same-device reproduction through a different transport, and the first recorded
row here whose
`container.image_digest` is not null:
`sha256:65425cfd9d31fb8f0e8d58d1548ad6b46704aabebfcc60d42b5e59d1f5f6f5f0`.

`total_size_bytes` differs by 112 (67080528 vs 67080416): safetensors header
padding, not content. The content digest covers the tensors, which is the point
of having one.

**The new capture is the more honest artifact.** It carries two disclosures the
published root does not: a `checkpoint_tensors_not_loaded` caveat and a
**blocking** `unexpected_tensors_overridden`, both about the 791 tensors of
Fruit's layer-13 MTP draft head, which `transformers` does not build. The
published root predates that guard and says nothing about them. The numbers
agree exactly; only the disclosure does not.

### It took four rentals, and every refusal was correct

Total spend **$0.30**. Not one attempt produced a wrong number; each stopped:

| # | stopped at | cause | now caught by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `--panel-dir has no panel.json` | the committed panels reached `engines/panels/` two commits before `bin/BUNDLE.txt`, so `container_prune` correctly stripped them | `selftest_container` **C5l**, statically |
| 2 | 791 homeless tensors | Fruit's MTP draft head; indistinguishable from a quantizer that silently did not engage | `--allow-unexpected-tensors`, blocking disclosure |
| 3 | generation sanity probe | Fruit answered `' the'`, not `Paris` — it is a proxy, not an assistant | `--sanity-expect ''`, which needs **argv as a list** |
| 4 | driver 12040 vs a cu130 image | the host's CUDA was 12.4 | `require_accelerator()` **C12** + `allowedCudaVersions` |

Attempt 3 is why `create(docker_cmd=[...])` exists: the documented remedy is an
EMPTY argument, and no flat `dockerArgs` string can carry one.

Attempt 4 is the one worth remembering. The bootstrap saw the dead accelerator
and reported `PASS 1b accelerator decode parity: SKIPPED (no CUDA and no MPS on
this host; the check RUNS on the instance, which is where it counts)` — on the
instance. `setup` passed, 10 GB was fetched, and the capture died on the first
`.to(cuda)`. Five cents here; a 117 GB fetch on a GLM-5.3 root.

---

## Which image ran, recorded

Two receipt fields that have been `null` on **every** capture this repository
has ever sealed now have an answer.

* `runtime.container.image_digest` — filled by `engines/tools/hf_capture.py` from
  `STACKPRINT_IMAGE_PIN` or the baked pin file, the convention
  `fidelity/stackprint.py` already reads. `docker load` strips the registry
  digest, so the file is the only identity that survives every transport; the
  build also writes an `image_content_sha256` over the resolved wheel versions,
  the pipeline commit, every applied patch and every bundled file.
* `produced_by.container_image` / `container_digest` — an SSH-driven instance
  has no git checkout, so the controller must compute `produced_by` on the
  caller's laptop and ship it. An image carries the revision, so a
  containerised run names its own code.

**Both are outside `stack_fingerprint_sha256`, on purpose.** That digest is
what `dscompare` reads to decide `stack_relation`, and a cross-stack verdict
stamps `usable_as_floor: false`. The container is *where* the stack ran, not
*what the stack is* — so recording it must not make a containerised capture
incomparable with the identical computation run outside one. Rung C8 asserts
that, and asserts that with no pin present the runtime receipt is byte-identical
to what it was before the field learned how to be filled: a published dataset
does not get to shift because we added a container.

---

## The acceptance test, and its result

**Acceptance criterion:** capture-content identity across environments on the
same actual execution device, model and panel. A mismatch needs investigation
of changed inputs/runtime, not dismissal as variance.

**Run, 2026-08-31, Lambda `gpu_1x_a10`: CPU forwards on an A10-equipped host.**
Both runtime receipts record `device: cpu`; setup GPU decode checks are not
the fixture's forward. The following is host-vs-image CPU evidence:

| | arm A — host bootstrap | arm B — the image |
|---|---|---|
| `capture_content_digest` | `b42ffe8f1d1dfcfdd784…a960549` | **identical** |
| per-window tensor digests | `552af179…`, `abd137ac…` | **identical** |
| `head.tensor_content_sha256` | `58b4b967…` | **identical** |
| `stack_fingerprint_sha256` | `18735425…` | **identical** |
| `lane_identity_sha256` | `2d0992fc…` | **identical** |
| `dataset_sha256` | `4d8eaae9…` | `587cbd6f…` — **differs, by design** |
| `runtime.container.image_digest` | `null` | `sha256:372d542c…` |
| `setup` stage | 134 s cold | 53–70 s (bootstrap all-no-op) |

Both arms captured `inference-optimization/GLM-5.3-Flash-0.1B-A0.1B` @
`7c3a6d3d` over a 2×256 panel built on the box from this repository's own docs
(510 scored positions), driven by the same `bin/container_entry.py` so that the
only variable between them was the environment. Evidence, including both
manifests and both runtime receipts:
[`reports/container-proof/`](../reports/container-proof/).

The dataset seals differ with their runtime/provenance metadata, including
the image record. Equal content and stack fingerprints classify the recorded
CPU captures as same-stack; they do not establish floor eligibility by
themselves or bypass the historical panel refusal below.

One detail worth keeping: the two arms did **not** have identical interpreters.
The host bootstrap installed python **3.12.13** from deadsnakes; the image has
Ubuntu 24.04's **3.12.3**. The tensors are still bit-identical, and the
fingerprint does not include the patch version — so this is evidence about how
much of the stack the digest actually pins, not a claim that patch versions
never matter.

`fidelity-dataset compare --self-compare` was **refused** on this pair, and
correctly: `PANEL-D6` compares the two captures' tokenizer identity, which is
recorded as the local path of the model tree (`/home/ubuntu/…/models/target`
vs `/workspace/…/models/target`). The current verified panel-binding route
records the panel's stable tokenizer identity. These old unbound manifests
are preserved, not resealed, and their refusal cannot establish a failure of
today's bound paid route. See [`REVIEW-DEFERRED.md`](REVIEW-DEFERRED.md).

The architecture study's paired GPU observations are finite controls, not a
universal driver/host exclusion. They also cannot turn the CPU experiment
above into GPU evidence. A new execution stack requires its own reproduction.

### One operational wart

The container runs as root, so everything it writes into the mount is
root-owned and a later `rm -rf` from the login user fails file by file. Either
run it with `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` or clean up with `sudo`. It is not a
correctness problem and it is exactly the kind of thing that only shows up the
second time you use the mount.

---

## Historical provider-container evidence

Direct provider-native container launch is **not an admitted measurement path**.
The current paid controller accepts only a fresh RunPod secure on-demand pod
over its authenticated SSH lifecycle, with a durable lease, installed reaper,
bounded retrieval and exact absence. Controller-loss proof and strict
campaign/billing admission are opt-in; default billing settlement is advisory.
See [`CLOUD-RECIPES.md`](CLOUD-RECIPES.md). Direct provider-native launches
and non-RunPod paid execution remain refused by the controller.

The container experiments below remain implementation evidence for the image;
they are not a runnable rental recipe. Use
[`THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md`](THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md) for the only current
paid boundary.

Three things that cost real money to learn:

* **The panel can come from the image.** `engines/panels/` ships two committed
  panels, so a container-native capture fetches no panel at all — but only if
  they are in `bin/BUNDLE.txt`. They landed in `engines/panels/` two commits
  before they landed in that list, and the image built in between refused its
  own committed panel on a rented L4: *"--panel-dir ... has no panel.json"*.
  `--require-all` proves every listed entry arrived; it cannot prove that what
  a capture needs was listed. `selftest_container.py` rung **C5l** now does.
* **`docker_args` is one flat string** *as this backend sends it*, because
  `podFindAndDeployOnDemand` is GraphQL and takes `dockerArgs` as a single
  string; an argument containing a space then depends on how the provider
  splits it. Prefer flags without spaces for now — `--gpu` is optional anyway,
  since the receipt's device name is read from torch by
  `fidelity/stackprint.py`, not from that flag. The real fix is the REST API:
  `POST /v1/pods` takes `dockerEntrypoint` and `dockerStartCmd` as **arrays**,
  so argv is a list and the quoting question disappears. Verified live.
* **A failed run's log is on a volume you cannot reach.** RunPod's REST API
  serves no logs and no files, and this image runs no sshd, so when a capture
  died at its `capture` stage the log had to be recovered by rewriting the
  running pod's entrypoint to `tar /workspace | curl` it out. That is why
  `--result-sink` now carries `logs/` (tail-capped) and why stdout prints the
  failing stage's log inline. Two better answers exist and are not yet wired:
  a `networkVolumeId` that outlives the pod, and the array entrypoint above.
* **Configuration and secrets travel in `env`, never in `docker_args`** — the
  args string is argv and RunPod returns it verbatim from
  `query { pod { dockerArgs } }`.

**Nested containers do not work on RunPod.** Probed on a live pod
(`NVIDIA RTX A4000`, community cloud, driver 580.126.20): running as uid 0 but
with `CapEff 0x00000000a80425fb` — the Docker default set, no `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` —
`unshare -U -r true` fails and `/dev/fuse` does not exist. So rootful podman
(needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` for mount namespaces) and rootless podman (needs
`CLONE_NEWUSER`, which the default seccomp profile blocks without
`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) are both out. Building the image *on* a RunPod pod is not a
route; the image has to arrive from a registry.

### Vast.ai (2026-09-05, transport rehearsal)

`bin/fidelity/vastapi.py` `create(docker_cmd=[...])` launches the image on Vast
via `PUT /api/v0/asks/{id}/` with `runtype: "ssh"` and the full command in
`onstart` (prep + `exec python3.12 .../container_entry.py capture ...`).
`env` is a **string in Docker flag format** (`-e KEY=VAL`), not a dict — the
REST API confirms this in its OpenAPI schema. `onstart` is limited to 4048
chars; gzip+base64 (Vast's own documented workaround) handles longer scripts.

| observed | detail |
|---|---|
| Tesla T4, Nevada, cuda_max 13.0, driver 580.126.09 | image loaded, accelerator detected, panel staged, job.json written |
| `--result-sink https://ntfy.sh/<topic>` | tar.gz delivered, HTTP 200, retrieved via `?poll=1` |
| **blocked at `setup`** | the Nevada host's network has a broken SSL proxy to huggingface.co (cert hostname mismatch); `stage_measure.sh` uses `urllib` with strict SSL and fails before any model fetch |
| spend | ~$0.08 across 6 attempts; balance $19.56 → $19.48; all instances destroyed |

The transport rehearsal exercised launch → image startup → failure result
frame → ntfy delivery → retrieval. It did **not** complete model fetch or
capture. Working TLS removes the observed blocker, not every possible
downstream failure, so a successful full forward cannot be promised.
The current authenticated Hub path is not bypassed with an unverified mirror.

---

## Supported CUDA image architecture

**The measurement image and cold-instance bootstrap support `linux/amd64`
(Linux `x86_64`) only.** This applies to both the default measurement image and
the separate RunPod SSH release target. Use an x86_64 CUDA host with
[`requirements-cu130-py312.lock`](../bin/requirements-cu130-py312.lock): its
72 exact distribution versions, HTTPS wheel URLs and SHA-256 hashes remain
unchanged. Python 3.12, `torch==2.11.0+cu130`, CUDA 13.0, `triton==3.6.0`,
`numpy==2.5.2`, `transformers==5.16.1` and numerical precision are not changed.

ARM and other unsupported hosts are refused by bootstrap before filesystem
changes, TLS traffic or installation; unsupported or misidentified Docker
targets are refused before apt/pip. Release plans and the workflow build only
`linux/amd64`. No ARM leg downloads x86 wheels, and no CPU, alternate-CUDA,

### Why an ARM filename is not an ARM closure

The 2026-09-08 index audit found same-version aarch64 filenames and hashes for
all 33 native wheels in an ARM candidate. That was **insufficient**:
[actual ARM CI](https://github.com/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-suite/actions/runs/34178473234/job/101912556514)
installed those wheels and validated the direct versions, including
`torch.version.cuda == "13.0"`, but then failed the required `pip check`:

```text
nvidia-cusparselt-cu13 0.8.0 is not supported on this platform
```

Inspection of the upstream ZIP identified the exact defect:

| Field | Upstream value |
|---|---|
| Filename | `nvidia_cusparselt_cu13-0.8.0-py3-none-manylinux2014_aarch64.whl` |
| Published SHA-256 | `400c6ed1cf6780fc6efedd64ec9f1345871767e6a1a0a552a1ea0578117ea77c` |
| Internal `.dist-info/WHEEL` tag | `py3-none-manylinux2014_sbsa` |
| Native `libcusparseLt.so.0` ELF machine | `183` (`AArch64`) |

The library is ARM, but `sbsa` is not the wheel platform tag `aarch64`.
The filename and internal compatibility declaration disagree, so the
installed-wheel validator correctly rejects it.
[NVIDIA's index](https://pypi.nvidia.com/nvidia-cusparselt-cu13/),
[PyPI's exact release](https://pypi.org/pypi/nvidia-cusparselt-cu13/0.8.0/json)
and [PyTorch's CUDA index](https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130/nvidia-cusparselt-cu13/)
all identify the same malformed artifact, not an alternate corrected
same-version wheel. [ARM torch's own metadata](https://download-r2.pytorch.org/whl/cu130/torch-2.11.0%2Bcu130-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_28_aarch64.whl.metadata)
requires cuSPARSELt **exactly 0.8.0**.

We do not suppress `pip check`, rewrite installed metadata, repack the wheel,
or silently substitute a newer numerical library. The unusable ARM lock is
not shipped. Re-enabling ARM requires a separately reviewed immutable,
internally valid closure (an upstream correction or an explicitly authorized,
provenance-tracked metadata-only repair), successful image validation, and
numerical qualification on the actual ARM CUDA GPU. Older `b76fb79` QEMU
timings do not validate this closure; neither successful imports nor an
emulated build would establish CUDA numerical parity.

## Releasing it

[`.github/workflows/container-image.yml`](../.github/workflows/container-image.yml)
builds `linux/amd64` and, once enabled, publishes to GHCR.

**Nothing is published until a maintainer says so.** The registry push is gated
on the repository variable `PUBLISH_CONTAINER`; unset, the workflow builds the
supported architecture, prints the plan and digests into the run summary, and pushes
nothing. Landing the file is not a decision to publish. Published releases
require `PUBLISH_CONTAINER=true` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
Variables). Manual workflow runs additionally require the default-false
**publish** input to be explicitly enabled for that run: neither switch can
override the other. Pull requests never publish, even with both switches on.

**The rules live in a script, not in `${{ }}`.** `bin/release_plan.py` decides
the tags, the platforms and the publish gate; the workflow calls it and builds
what it said. A workflow expression is untestable anywhere except GitHub — you
find out it was wrong by pushing a tag and reading a red run — so
`bin/selftest_container.py` rung C11 drives that script with known inputs and
known answers, offline:

```bash
python3 bin/release_plan.py --event release --ref refs/tags/v1.2.3 \
    --sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --publish true
```

| ref | tags |
|---|---|
| `refs/tags/v1.2.3` | `sha-<12>`, `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`, `latest` |
| `refs/tags/v1.2.3-rc1` | `sha-<12>`, `1.2.3` — a prerelease never moves the series tags or `latest` |
| `refs/heads/main` | `sha-<12>`, `main` |
| `workflow_dispatch` | `sha-<12>`, `dev` |

The `sha-<12>` tag is always first and is what the image records as its own
`IMAGE_REFERENCE`, because a receipt needs a reference that still means these
bytes tomorrow and `latest` never does.

**Platform support is checked, not inferred from filenames.** The contract
selftest verifies release/workflow agreement, the declared lock's wheel
filenames and hashes, and early ARM refusal. Image builds also run `pip check`,
which validates installed wheel metadata; the filename-only audit did not
catch the malformed ARM cuSPARSELt tag and is not a substitute for this gate.

**The digest is the point.** `produced_by.container_digest` has been `null` on
every row this repository has published. The `manifest` job prints the digest of
the published image tag it just created, together with the exact command that cites
it:

```
docker run --gpus all -v /data:/workspace \
  ghcr.io/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-measure:sha-<12> capture ... --image-pin sha256:<digest>
```

That value lands in the capture receipt as `runtime.container.image_digest` and
in `produced_by.container_digest`.

## The changelog is generated

```bash
bin/changelog.py                 # since the last tag
bin/changelog.py --all --out CHANGELOG.md
bin/changelog.py --check         # what CI (and rung C11q) runs
```

Not git-cliff, not release-drafter — both assume Conventional Commits: a short
subject, a machine-readable type, and a body nobody reads. This repository's
commits are the opposite, long-form prose explaining what failed and why, and
by a convention that has held across the whole history the **first line is
already a changelog entry**. So the generator takes that line, splits the topic
off at the first colon, and groups by topic; adding a tool would add a
dependency, a config file and a second convention to produce the same list.

The topic rule is deliberately strict about the leading lowercase letter, since
a subject can also open with a file (`AGENTS.md:`), an identifier (`REFC-006:`)
or a flag (`--pipeline-root:`) — grouping by those gives one section per commit,
which is a list with extra headings rather than a changelog.
