# Which GPU cloud, and what a measurement actually costs on it

**Historical snapshot: 2026-08-31 UTC. 32 measured rentals across four
providers.** Prices and stock move fast; every number below is dated and
derived from a committed benchmark receipt under
[`reports/provider-bench/`](../reports/provider-bench/), not typed into prose.
The table can be regenerated offline:

```bash
python3 bin/provider_bench_table.py reports/provider-bench
python3 bin/provider_bench_table.py reports/provider-bench --per-rental
```

**Safety status.** These receipts are evidence, not an executable paid recipe.
The historical `fidelity-bench` provider paths do not implement the current
RunPod lease, independent-reaper, campaign-budget, host-authentication and
billing closure. Do not rerun them against a provider account. Current paid
execution is the exact RunPod-only route in
[`THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md`](THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md).

**No affiliation.** This project has no relationship with Vast.ai, RunPod,
Lambda or JarvisLabs beyond holding prepaid credit on each and paying retail.
Nothing here is sponsored and no provider reviewed it. The survey's historical
spend is bound in its receipts; it is not a current price or budget promise.

## Dollars per hour is the wrong metric

A card at three times the hourly rate that finishes in a third of the time is a
wash. What decides the bill for a fidelity measurement is **dollars per
window**, and that is `minutes/window x $/hour` — two numbers that are only
comparable when they come from the same rental.

The historical instrument rented one instance, measured the inner loop, read
the rate back from that resource, tore it down and wrote a receipt. Those
receipts remain auditable; the old controller is no longer an admitted paid
path.

**What the streaming lane spends its time on.** Per window it walks every
routed expert matrix, uploads it, dequantises it, does one skinny GEMM against
a 2047-token block, and throws the weights away. GLM-5.3-Flash is 42 layers x
288 experts x 3 projections = 36,288 of those per window. That loop is
**host-bandwidth-bound**, not compute-bound, and the table below is the proof:
a B200 with 7.7x an A100's bf16 throughput finishes the step 2.7x faster,
tracking its host-to-device bandwidth almost exactly.

`$/window` is the streaming lane's **inner loop** priced at the rate that
rental was billing. It is not the whole cost of a measurement — a real run also
pays bootstrap, a 200 GB fetch, materialize and the panel, which
`bin/measure-cloud --dry-run` estimates and this does not. Two consequences,
both of which cut the same way:

* The ranking is of **this inner-loop benchmark**, not an established ranking
  of complete captures. Fetch, decode, setup, storage, scheduler, CPU/BLAS,
  network locality and failure/retry costs can change the end-to-end order.
* If this loop is a fraction *f* of wall time, halving it alone saves *f*/2.
  Other phases need their own measurements; the winner or loser in this
  column need not win or lose by more in a real run.

## The Lambda question, answered

Lambda's headline looks terrible: **$4.29/h for an H100 SXM5 against Vast's
$0.575/h for an A100 80GB PCIe**, seven and a half times the rate. The obvious
hypothesis is that an H100 is fast enough to make that back. It is not, and the
reason is structural rather than a matter of a few percent.

**1. The ceiling on this lane is a PCIe generation, and it is low.** Measured
host-to-device bandwidth, warm, grouped by the link `nvidia-smi` reports under
load, across all 32 measured rentals:

| link, under load | rentals | h2d, warm |
|---|---|---|
| Gen3 x16 | 2 | 12.3 – 12.4 GB/s |
| Gen4 x16 | 11 | 23.3 – 27.9 GB/s |
| Gen5 x16 | 16 | 38.3 – 57.7 GB/s |
| **Gen4 x1** (GH200; the link is not the path) | 3 | **378.6 – 403.9 GB/s** |

Across these sampled PCIe hosts, warm bandwidth reached at most 57.7 GB/s,
about 2.2x the cited A100's 26.7 GB/s. Their measured per-matrix advantage
reached about 2.7x. These are observed ratios for the instrument's shapes and
software, not physical ceilings for all PCIe hardware or future drivers.
At the dated prices, the sampled Lambda H100 PCIe inner-loop rate did not
offset its hourly premium over the sampled Vast A100. No inference about
every Lambda offering or a full layer-outer capture follows from that ratio.

**3. And then Lambda wins outright — on the one instance type that is not
PCIe-attached.** `gpu_1x_gh200`, $2.29/h:

| | A100 80GB PCIe (Vast, $0.581/h) | GH200 (Lambda, $2.29/h) |
|---|---|---|
| host→device, warm | 26.7 GB/s | **379 – 404 GB/s** |
| per-matrix step | 0.891 ms | **0.098 ms** |
| min/window (inner loop) | 0.54 | **0.06** |
| **$/window** | $0.00522 | **$0.00227** |

A GH200 reaches host memory over NVLink-C2C, not over PCIe, so it is not
subject to the ceiling that decides every other row. Fourteen times the
bandwidth, nine times faster per matrix, at four times the hourly rate — which
nets out to **2.3x cheaper per priced inner-loop window than the cited rental**,
and 2.5x cheaper than the best *median* row there, on
fleet hardware at a stable published price rather than a stranger's PC. Three
independent rentals measured 0.097, 0.098 and 0.099 ms — a 2% spread, against
2.25x on RunPod's secure H100s.

**Within this historical survey, GH200 had the cheapest priced inner loop.**
That is not a permanent provider ranking or an end-to-end measurement quote.
The GH200 benchmark used torch 2.7/CUDA 12.8, not the production
torch 2.11/cu130 capture stack; its transport/runtime and full capture
correctness require separate qualification before using that route.

**Two caveats, both load-bearing.**

* `nvidia-smi` on that GH200 reports **`Gen4 x1 of Gen4 x1`** — the exact
  signature of the oversubscribed host that `--min-h2d-gbps` exists to refuse —
  while moving 379 GB/s. Its PCIe link is vestigial. Anything that gates on
  link *width* rather than on measured GB/s will refuse the fastest machine it
  can rent. `bench.gate` deliberately gates on `h2d_GBps` alone.
* A GH200's 96 GB is enough for this lane and its host memory is coherent and
  large, but it is a different device: **bitwise determinism is a per-device
  property** (`llms.txt`, and §5 of `CLOUD-RECIPES.md`). Reproducing a number
  there is a result worth publishing, not an assumption worth making.

### Postscript: the H100 SXM5, and why we still have no number for it

`gpu_1x_h100_sxm5` — the $4.29/h card the whole question was about — produced
**no measurement at all**, and the reasons are worth more than the number would
have been. Over 2026-08-31, 11:23–13:59 UTC — **eleven launch attempts, eight
instances created, one usable GPU** — this happened:

1. **Capacity was thin, and thinnest exactly when we started.** A two-minute
   poll of `regions_with_capacity_available` for eight single-GPU types ran for
   2 h 11 m (66 polls). `gpu_1x_h100_sxm5` was available in **0 of the first
   21** and 15 of the remaining 45 — 15/66 overall — against 66/66 for
   `gpu_1x_a100_sxm4`, 48/66 for `gpu_1x_h100_pcie`, 47/66 for `gpu_1x_gh200`,
   and **0/66** for `gpu_1x_b200_sxm6`, which we never got to try at all. Raw
   log: [`lambda-capacity-poll.jsonl`](../reports/provider-bench/lambda-capacity-poll.jsonl).
2. **When it said yes, the launch sometimes said no.** A 15-second watcher
   caught brief windows the two-minute poll missed and fired at each. **Three
   of eleven** attempts were refused outright: `HTTP 400
   instance-operations/launch/insufficient-capacity`.
3. **Seven of the eight instances that DID launch had no usable GPU.** Each
   reached `active` with an IP and a working sshd after 238–333 s — and on
   seven of them, `torch.cuda.is_available()` was **False**.
   `nvidia-smi` was perfectly happy on them (driver 570.148.08, CUDA 12.8, an
   H100 80GB HBM3 at 27 °C and 0 % util); the failure is inside CUDA:

   ```
   CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount().
   Error 802: system not yet initialized
   ```

   `torch.cuda.device_count()` returned **1** while `is_available()` returned
   False. One box was probed every 60 s for six minutes and never recovered,
   and four others were probed four times across three and a half minutes each,
   so this is not a slow boot. Capacity for this type appeared only in
   `us-south-3` and `us-south-2`.
4. **One in eight was fine.** At 13:04 UTC a single rental of the same type
   answered `True` on the first probe. So error 802 here is a **per-host
   condition on this instance type**, not a property of the type — the same
   shape as every other heterogeneity finding in this document, except that
   this time it is a fleet rather than a marketplace. It is also not simply a
   stopped NVSwitch Fabric Manager, the usual cause of 802: on the healthy box
   `nvidia-fabricmanager` was **inactive and disabled**, `nvidia-smi -q`
   reported `Fabric State: Completed`, and starting the service failed
   outright. The evidence, unedited, is in
   [`exhibits/lambda-h100-sxm5-cuda-802.md`](../reports/provider-bench/exhibits/lambda-h100-sxm5-cuda-802.md).

The healthy one was a diagnostic run, torn down before the pattern was clear. **So this table has no
H100 SXM5 row, and saying so is the honest outcome**: seven of eight rentals of
a $4.29/h card could not have run a measurement, and the one that could was a
diagnostic run already torn down before the pattern was clear. Four further
attempts after that produced three more 802s and one capacity refusal.

Two things follow that do not depend on the missing number.

**The arithmetic is unaffected.** The verdict above rests on Lambda's H100
PCIe, rented twice, which is *cheaper per hour* than the SXM5 ($3.29 vs $4.29).
An SXM5 would have to be 1.3x faster than the PCIe part merely to match its
dollars per window, and the PCIe part is already 3.4x adrift of a Vast A100.
Nothing an SXM5 could plausibly measure would change the ranking.

**And the tool changed.** An instance the API calls `active`, which accepts an
SSH connection, is not yet a machine with a GPU — the same lesson as this
project's older "watch run STATE, not output counts". `fidelity-bench` now
refuses to write a receipt when the payload reports `no cuda` or produces no
`stream_matrix_ms`, retrying that one error four times across three minutes
first. The first of these rentals wrote a receipt of zeros before that guard
existed: it tabulated as a very slow machine, and nothing in it said the card
was missing.

## Qualifying the GH200 for real work: what a micro-benchmark could not tell us

**2026-08-31, 14:40–16:35 UTC. `malaiwah/GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit-bf16` (10.10 GB),
the sealed 16-window Fruit panel, `bin/measure-cloud --role root`.** The table
above was produced by `bin/fidelity-bench`, which uploads one payload and times
a loop. It never built this suite's stack and never captured anything. This
section is what happened when the real thing was pointed at the same machine.
Evidence: [`reports/gh200-qualification/`](../reports/gh200-qualification/).

### The stack builds on aarch64, and it is not close

`gpu_1x_gh200` is a **Grace Hopper superchip: the host CPU is ARM**
(`aarch64`, Ubuntu 22.04.5, kernel `6.8.0-1013-nvidia-64k`, 64 KB pages,
64 vCPU / 432 GB). `bin/bootstrap_measure.sh` had never run on one. It
completed in **98 seconds**, and the whole `setup` stage — bootstrap plus every
offline selftest — in **4 m 02 s**, the same as x86:

```
14:57:17 installing python3.12 (deadsnakes)     -> Python 3.12.13   (27 s)
14:57:46 installing the pinned wheel set        -> 67 s
         torch 2.11.0+cu130 cuda 13.0 | transformers 5.16.1 |
         safetensors 0.8.0 | numpy 2.5.2 | hf_transfer 0.1.9
14:58:53 patches 0001-0006 + 0008 applied, pipeline import OK
14:58:55 exllamav3 NOT built: the measurement path imports the pipeline without it
         tr3 / dione / dione-stream / exl3hf / gguf offline selftests: all pass
```

Nothing needed porting. deadsnakes publishes `arm64` for jammy and noble, and
PyTorch publishes `torch-2.11.0+cu130-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_28_aarch64.whl`;
`kbnf`, `hf_transfer`, `safetensors` and `tokenizers` all ship `aarch64`
wheels, and `formatron`, `pydantic`, `transformers` and `accelerate` are pure
Python. The **gguf offline selftest matters most of the four**: its rung 1b
re-decodes committed real bytes on the box's own CUDA device and demands
`torch.equal` against the reference — so a bitwise decode check passed on
ARM+Hopper.

**The ARM landmines that do exist were never reached, and that is luck rather
than design.** `bootstrap_measure.sh`'s exllamav3 branch hardcodes a
`flash_attn-...-linux_x86_64.whl` and a `cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/`
keyring. The probe skips that branch because the measurement path imports the
pipeline without exllamav3 — so the **capture and streaming lanes are ARM-clean,
and any lane that needs exllamav3 is not**. Nobody should discover that on a
rental.

### The `Gen4 x1` question, answered on a real run

`measure-cloud`'s post-setup gate ran with `--min-h2d-gbps 100` and **passed**:

```
machine measured  ok  h2d 365.2 GB/s (cold 274.0), expert GEMM 763 TF,
                      PCIe Gen4 x1 of Gen4 x1
```

`bench.gate` reads `h2d_GBps` and ignores link width, exactly as its docstring
promises, so the fastest machine in this survey is not refused by the check
written to catch oversubscribed hosts. The x86 control measured the other side
of that ceiling on the same day: RunPod A100-SXM4-80GB, three rentals,
**20.7 / 21.7 / 22.8 GB/s** at `Gen4 x16 of Gen4 x16`. **16x the bandwidth over
a link one lane wide.**

### Six defects, each of which ends a rented root capture

None of these are ARM. All were found by running, and all are now fixed with
regression tests (`035aa7e`, `1659165`):

| what | where it bit |
|---|---|
| `sniff_surface` read `torch_dtype` and `text_config.dtype`, never top-level `dtype` | a plain bf16 tree — the only thing a root capture reads — refused as "no recognised surface marker", for $0.00 |
| Lambda's run root was `/home/jl_fs`, and Lambda logs in as `ubuntu` | `mkdir: Permission denied`; every Lambda rental died at the bundle upload |
| `_await_stage` called `jl.run_status(run_id)`, which every SSH backend refuses without an instance | a FAILED stage never ended the poll on runpod/vast/lambda. Measured: capture exited non-zero at 15:03:2x, un-noticed at 15:12, GPU at 0% |
| `--sanity-expect` was read by `race_capture` only | on the default path the generation probe ran **unenforced** |
| no `--allow-unexpected-tensors` route | any checkpoint with an MTP/draft block died at capture. Fruit's 791 unhoused tensors are its MTP layer 13; GLM-5.3-Flash and GLM-5.3 have the same shape |
| `--device` was never passed, and `hf_capture` defaults to `cpu` | **the forward ran on the CPU of a box rented for its GPU** |

The last is the one that would have made this whole comparison meaningless.
On the A100 the CPU capture logged
`progress: layer-outer forwards 1/221 0% [07:03<25:52:22, 423.4 s/it]`,
settling near 30 s per forward; on the GPU the same work is **0.0173 s per
window**. The GH200's idle `0 %, 2 MiB` during its capture stage was this bug,
not the hardware.

### What a root capture actually costs, end to end

RunPod A100-SXM4-80GB, $1.39/h, x86_64, the complete four stages:

| stage | wall | note |
|---|---|---|
| setup | 4 m 02 s | bootstrap + five offline selftests |
| fetch_target | 2 m 01 s | 10.10 GB |
| capture | 2 m 01 s | 16 windows + the probe |
| verify | 2 m 01 s | seal + digest chain + tensor content |
| **total rental** | **11 min** | **billed $0.26** (estimate said $2.47) |

**Read those stage times as upper bounds.** `_await_stage` polls every 120 s,
so every stage that finishes inside two minutes reports `2 m 01 s`. The honest
per-window figure is the capture manifest's own: **0.0173 s/window mean** on the
A100, against **0.253 s/window** on the L4 that captured the published root.
For a root capture, `$/window` from the table above does not transfer at all —
that column prices the streaming lane's *per-window expert upload*, and a
layer-outer root capture loads each layer **once for the whole panel**. The
GH200's 16x bandwidth advantage applies to a term that a root capture pays once.

### The finding that decides the dual-root question

`docs/ARCHITECTURE-DETERMINISM.md` says the root's hardware sets the regime.
Here is that effect measured directly, for the first time, on the root rather
than inferred from candidate rows — the **same published quant**
(`malaiwah/fruit-fidelity-quant-siq-v1`), the **same sealed panel**, the **same
fp64 estimator**, against two roots of the same weights captured on two GPUs:

| root captured on | mean tokenwise KLD of the same quant | top-1 |
|---|---|---|
| NVIDIA L4 (the published root) | 0.038737449793 | 0.8797631 |
| NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB (this run) | 0.038844450282 | 0.8786334 |
| **difference** | **1.070e-04 nats — 0.276 %** | −0.113 pp |

For context, the three **different experiments** reported:

| | model | KLD | hardware term, absolute | relative |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| toy | 16 layers, hidden 1024, vocab 32768 | 6.3e-05 | 3.49e-06 | 5.5 % |
| **Fruit SIQ exl3 K3/K4** | **13 built layers, hidden 1024, vocab 154880** | **0.03874** | **1.070e-04** | **0.276 %** |
| GLM-5.3-Flash 2.05bpw | 45 layers, vocab 154880 | 0.1219 | 2.973e-04 | 0.245 % |

These experiments differ in architecture, depth/width, quantization and
runtime. They do not identify a universal depth scaling law or transferable
0.25% hardware budget. The Fruit root-to-root KL was **4.467e-03** nats
(top-1 0.9657); changing the root in this candidate comparison shifted KL by
**1.070e-04**. The ratio is descriptive, not proof that "41.7x cancels":
KL is not an additive distance and the experiments do not isolate a shared
component. No universal lower/upper bound for candidate divergence follows.

**Statistical scope:** the paired window diagnostics were mean 1.070e-04,
sd 6.147e-04, t=0.70, with 8 windows moving each way. These describe this
finite panel conditional on captures and replay arithmetic. Window t is
not calibrated population evidence without source-document provenance and a
sampling model. Neither this t value nor the observed 0.276% difference proves
generalization to other panels, artifacts or hardware.

Harness control: the same code reproduces the published registry row
(`measurement--fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1`, 0.038737453713514176) as
0.038737449793 — 3.9e-09 apart, with top-1 agreement identical to all ten
digits — and a capture compared against a byte-identical copy of itself returns
**exactly 0.0 nats at top-1 1.0** over all 32,752 positions with
`--force-compute`, i.e. with the math actually run rather than short-circuited
on the digest.

### The GH200 capacity reality, and it is worse than 47-of-66

The survey's poll said `gpu_1x_gh200` was rentable in 47 of 66 two-minute
polls. Trying to actually rent one for an hour, at 45-second polls
([`lambda-capacity-poll.jsonl`](../reports/gh200-qualification/lambda-capacity-poll.jsonl)):

* `regions_with_capacity_available` was **empty for 28 continuous minutes**
  (15:28–15:56 UTC) and empty again from 16:19 on;
* of five launches fired while the catalogue said yes, **two were refused** with
  `HTTP 400 instance-operations/launch/insufficient-capacity`;
* of three instances that did launch, **two came up `unhealthy`** — created,
  billed, never reaching `active`, sshd never answering. `_endpoint` waits 900 s
  for `active`, so an unhealthy box costs a quarter-hour of rental unless
  something destroys it.

Five of eight attempts produced nothing. That is evidence of scheduling risk
in this dated survey, not authorization for automatic paid retry loops.
The current controller refuses Lambda measurement execution.

## What a price cannot express

Verified against the live APIs on 2026-08-31, not read off marketing pages.

| | Vast.ai | RunPod | Lambda | JarvisLabs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| shape | **marketplace** — you rent one stranger's machine | community (marketplace) + secure (datacentre) | fleet | fleet |
| balance from the API | yes | yes | **no** — pay-as-you-go, bills after the fact | yes |
| storage outlives the instance | no | no | no | **yes** — separable filesystems |
| choose the disk size | yes, at rent time | yes | **no** — fixed per instance type | yes |
| spot / interruptible | offered; this suite rents on-demand | offered (bid price); this suite rents on-demand | **none at all** | yes, containers only (H200 $1.99 vs $3.99) |
| rate readable per instance | yes (`dph_total`) | yes (`costPerHr`) | yes (`price_cents_per_hour`) | **no** — only a running total; priced from the catalogue |
| rent→benchmark→destroy, over 32 rentals | 38 s – 550 s (n=10) | **28 s – 67 s** (n=12) | 165 s – 478 s (n=7) | **31 s – 32 s** (n=3) |
| reproducibility across rentals of one card | 1.0–1.5x | **up to 2.25x** | 1.01–1.32x | **1.00x** |
| the sharp edge | heterogeneous hosts; see below | secure ≠ uniform; see below | capacity, slow boots, no balance API | on-demand rows were invisible to this suite until today |

**Lambda has no balance endpoint.** Budgeting a run against it means trusting
your own arithmetic; there is nothing to reconcile against, and `bin/measure-cloud`'s
four-way cost report (estimated / computed / billed / balance-delta) loses its
fourth column there. Keep runs small until you have seen an invoice.

The historical JarvisLabs campaign used a separable filesystem to preserve
downloaded weights across instance loss. The old claim that no other provider
offers persistent storage was too broad (RunPod exposes network volumes).
Provider feature existence is not current controller admission: the safe
RunPod route uses the storage/lifecycle modes named in the quickstart.

## The heterogeneity caveat, with today's receipts

A catalogue row is not a machine. Four things happened during this survey, all
on the same afternoon:

**One rental was not the card the listing advertised.** Vast ask `48665056`
listed a **B200, 179 GB, Virginia**. What came up was an **H100 80GB HBM3**
whose host-to-device bandwidth *fell* under sustained load — 27.6 GB/s cold,
13.8 GB/s warm — and which took 1.663 ms per matrix, worse than a $0.58 A100.
The receipt is kept as
[`exhibits/vast-ask48665056-listed-b200-got-h100.json`](../reports/provider-bench/exhibits/vast-ask48665056-listed-b200-got-h100.json)
and excluded from the aggregate. Renting the same card **by name** a few minutes
later produced a genuine B200 at 0.367 ms. Whatever the mechanism — a recycled
ask id, a re-chunked bundle — the operational rule is the same: **on a
marketplace an offer id is not a durable name for one machine, and the only
check that works is measuring what you actually got.**

**One host billed for fifteen minutes and never accepted a connection.** Vast
ask `48850759` reported `running` throughout while
`ssh1.vast.ai:27118 never accepted a connection within 898s`. The rental cost
about $0.30 and produced nothing. Teardown fired from `finally` and the
instance is gone.

**Seven rentals in eight came up with no usable GPU.** Seven of eight Lambda
`gpu_1x_h100_sxm5` instances reached `active` with a working sshd and a happy
`nvidia-smi`, and answered `torch.cuda.is_available() == False` with CUDA error
802; one was fine. A fleet is not automatically a uniform one. See the
postscript above. The first of them wrote a receipt of zeros, which is why
`fidelity-bench` now refuses to.

**And host variance is not a Vast-only phenomenon.** RunPod's *secure* cloud —
a datacentre product, one flat price — gave 0.513, 1.096, 1.110 and 1.139 ms
per matrix across four rentals of `NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3` at $3.29/h. Same SKU,
same price, **2.2x** between the best and worst machine. Its A100-SXM4 spread
2.25x and its B200 1.9x. By contrast JarvisLabs reproduced to 0.5% across three
rentals and Lambda's GH200 to 2% across three.

This small survey illustrates that catalogue/provider labels do not determine
host performance. `host spread` is the observed sample range, not a population
reliability estimate or a price uniquely attached to marketplace tiers.

The defence is already in the tool. `bin/measure-cloud` accepts
`--min-h2d-gbps`, checked after setup and before the fetch, which is the last
moment a bad machine is still cheap to walk away from.

---

## How to read this snapshot now

The rows answer one historical question: what each measured host charged for
the benchmarked inner loop on that date. They do not answer whether capacity,
prices, lifecycle APIs or safety closure are current. They also do not
authorize selecting the numerically cheapest provider.

Current paid support is narrower: one exact secure on-demand RunPod/SSH route.
The controller still probes host-to-device bandwidth after setup and before the
large fetch, but it reaches that point only after the current lifecycle,
campaign and scientific gates pass.

## Reproducing the tables offline

```bash
python3 bin/provider_bench_table.py reports/provider-bench
python3 bin/provider_bench_table.py reports/provider-bench --per-rental
```

Do not use the historical benchmark controller to create rentals. New provider
receipts require a separately reviewed and drilled lifecycle closure before any
paid reproduction. See [`CLOUD-RECIPES.md`](CLOUD-RECIPES.md) for the current
safety boundary and [`CLOUD-PROVIDERS.md`](CLOUD-PROVIDERS.md) for admission
requirements.
