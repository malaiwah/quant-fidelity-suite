# GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-8bpw (K8)

**The first 8-bit (K8) TR3/MCG trellis quantization of
[zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash)** —
321B-total / A18B MoE, `glm5_next` hybrid architecture. Routed experts and the
MTP layer quantized at K8 (128-word trellis, MCG `0xCBAC1FED`); everything else
(KDA linear-attention layers, DSA indexer, hyper-connections, routers, norms,
embeddings, lm_head) **bit-exact native BF16**. 331.4 GB — within 1% of the
official FP8 release's footprint, at 1.66× lower divergence.

## Quality — SEALED, full panel, two bitwise-identical cold runs

> ### ⚠ Scope disclosure — this number is a **panel25** number
>
> Added 2026-08-29. **Nothing here is a correction: 0.012384 is and remains the
> correct mean over the full 25-window panel.** What changed is that the panel is
> now known to contain calibration-adjacent windows, so the scope has to travel
> with the number.

**Mean KLD(teacher ‖ K8) = 0.012384191023436866** over the full sealed panel
(25 windows / 51,175 positions), **two cold runs producing identical means to
the last digit** (`bitwise_deterministic: true`). Quality gate passed.
Receipt: [`receipts/stream-k8-kld.json`](receipts/stream-k8-kld.json).

| Model | Mean KLD (nats) | Size | Lane |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **This K8** | **0.012384** | 331 GB | streaming, 2 runs |
| [K6](https://huggingface.co/malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-6bpw) | 0.013715 | 254 GB | streaming, 2 runs |
| K6 (sealed 8×H200, 5 runs) | 0.013723 | 254 GB | sealed EP8 |
| Official FP8 | 0.020615 | 328 GB | cross-stack |
| brandonmusic 4bpw | 0.024555 | 176 GB | his stack |
| 0xSero Dione Q4 | 0.027263 | 188 GB | [our measurement](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-fidelity-suite-v1/blob/main/reports/dione-q4-packed-kld.json) |
| NVFP4 | 0.060535 | ~180 GB | his stack, 1 window |

**At the same footprint as the official FP8 release (331 vs 328 GB), K8 is
1.66× closer to the BF16 teacher** — and 1.11× closer than K6 at 30 % more
bytes. Weight-space corroboration: with the intermediate-channel permutation
undone, K8's shipped store is **13.2× tighter in NMSE** than K6's (3.505e-5 vs
4.624e-4, better in 30 of 30 sampled matrices).

**Lane disclosure.** Measured on the single-GPU *streaming* lane (~$6/model),
not the 8×H200 sealed lane. The lanes were bridged on this exact panel: K6
reads 0.013714889 streaming vs 0.013723385 sealed — **−8.5e-6 (0.06 %)**, with
the worst single window differing by 2.9e-4. The streaming receipt sets
`publishable_as_reproduction: false` because a different expert-combine order
is an independent measurement that agrees closely, not a bitwise reproduction.

**Methodology note worth stealing.** A single-window comparison of these two
rates is *statistically meaningless*: on the sealed 25-window panel the
per-window KLD scatter has sd 7.2e-3 (K6) / 6.9e-3 (K8), and even the paired
per-window K6−K8 delta has sd 2.0e-3, against an effect of 1.33e-3. On one unlucky window (`window-0000`)
K8 appeared *worse* than K6; over the full panel it wins decisively. Never
quote a single-window KLD as a rate comparison —

### Excess over control (the floor removed)

(Called "quantization-attributable error" before 2026-08-31; renamed per
peer-review P1-05 — the difference estimates excess divergence over the
same-lane unquantized control and is **not** a causal attribution.)

Scoring the **unquantized BF16 weights** against this teacher on this panel
already costs **0.011506 nats** — the price of the comparison itself (teacher
captured on a different runtime; bf16 addition is not associative across
differing expert-combine orders). Two cold runs, identical means. Removing it:

| | panel KLD | excess over control |
|---|---:|---:|
| BF16 (floor) | 0.011506 | — |
| K8 (331 GB) | 0.012384 | **0.000878** |
| K6 (254 GB) | 0.013715 | **0.002209** |

K8's residual is smaller than K6's — 0.000878 vs 0.002209 nats — where the raw
means sit only 1.11x apart, because the floor is common to both rows and
dominates both. **The previously published ratio of the two residuals
("2.52x") is withdrawn**: a ratio of small residuals magnifies control error
and carried no uncertainty. Read the residuals beside the raw values, with the
floor named. Method, receipts and the ways this subtraction can be misused:
[BF16-FLOOR.md](https://github.com/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-suite/blob/main/engines/BF16-FLOOR.md).

## What this is (and is not)

- **Codec:** EXL3-format TR3/MCG trellis (turboderp's
  [exllamav3](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3) kernels @ `c5d9c657`),
  through [brandonmusic's GLM-5.3 pipeline](https://github.com/brandonmmusic-max/glm-5.3-flash-exl3-4bpw)
  with a disclosed patch series. His published core admits K3/K4/K5, so **K8 is
  a declared rate extension** — our encoder was verified **byte-identical** to
  his sealed core across 120 encodes / 624 MiB / 0 differing bytes
  ([evidence](https://github.com/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-suite/blob/main/engines/fallback/closure-comparison.json),
  [issue #1](https://github.com/brandonmmusic-max/glm-5.3-flash-exl3-4bpw/issues/1)).

  [`malaiwah/glm52-exl3-vast`](https://github.com/malaiwah/glm52-exl3-vast)
  with `MODEL_PROFILE=glm53-k8`. The image pins the qualified Glm5Next vLLM,
  B12X sparse-attention stack, native EXL3 K8 extension, CUDA, and fail-closed
  runtime overlays as one contract.
- **Not stock exllamav3/TabbyAPI or stock upstream vLLM:** those stacks do not
  carry this complete `glm5_next` + TR3/MCG K8 serving path.
- **Topology-neutral checkpoint:** canonical unsharded tensors; TP layout is a
  load-time decision. The qualified deployment is exactly TP4/DCP4 on four
  96 GiB RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs.
- **Measured memory:** the packaged runtime loads 76.31 GiB of model tensors per
  rank. At GMU 0.93, profiling reported 78.94–78.97 GiB weights + non-torch,
  2.25 GiB peak activations, zero CUDA-graph memory, and 7.10–7.14 GiB KV per
  GPU.
- **Parts-bin sibling:** encoded with the **same transform seed and calibration
  as [K6](https://huggingface.co/malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-6bpw)**, so the two
  per-choice payload stores are mix-and-matchable — a K6K8 multi-precision build
  (e.g. K8 on `down_proj`, K6 on gate/up) is **offline CPU assembly, no GPU
  re-encode**. The parts bin is published: [GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-partsbin-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-partsbin-v1).

## Provenance & disclosed deviations

Pins: BF16 source `zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16` (weights == `a6c167b6`);
calibration = brandonmusic's published EP4 captures (sealed inventory
`f56e9d62…` adopted verbatim). Deviations, all receipted: encoded on 4×H200
SM90 (his campaign attests 4×B200 SM100; fat `9.0;10.0` extension build), K4-KL
gate satisfied via a disclosed bridge document carrying his real published K4
receipt hashes, measurement on the streaming lane at EP8 emulation with fp32
combine order. Materialization receipt: bits 8, `complete`,
`main_and_mtp_complete`, `nonrouted_native_exact`, 331,449,761,784 logical
bytes, 37,152 routed choices, 1,618 native tensors.

## Lineage on the Hub

Z.ai published two sibling roots for this model and neither declares the other:
[`zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash) (the
**FP8** release, where most traffic lands) and
[`zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16`](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16)
(the **BF16** weights). This quant declares BF16 as its `base_model` because
that is what it was actually quantized from — the FP8 release is a *sibling*
quantization of the same model, not our source, and it is the baseline we
measure against rather than build on. Quants that list FP8 as their base were
genuinely made from the FP8 weights; the trees differ for real reasons.

## Serving — live-qualified turnkey profile

### Qualification result

The shipped profile is **`glm53-k8`**. It was booted on 4× RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell 96 GiB and passed arithmetic, factual, instruction-following, strict
structured-output, and tokenizer-exact 32K retrieval startup gates. The final
published image was then pulled by digest and smoke-tested without source or
runtime-overlay mounts.

- Published appliance: `ghcr.io/malaiwah/glm52-exl3-vast@sha256:5a0d4b370e9f6a2ef85fa8b8c213492122554b34ba18d630a3a78130758914cf`
- Shape: TP4 / DCP4 A2A, B12X sparse MLA, Triton MoE, native EXL3 K8,
  calibrated NVFP4-DS MLA KV, MTP off, eager mode, batch 512, C8, GMU 0.93
- Request limit: **458,752 tokens**; text-only qualification scope

### Why K8 uses the native eager path

The eight overlapping 16-bit MCG windows for K8 span 72 bits, while B12X's
fused EXL3 decoder represents that state in two 64-bit words. The runtime
therefore fails closed instead of merely widening the fused decoder's bitrate
guard. This profile uses ExLlamaV3's compiled native K8 extension and passes the
actual uniform layer bitrate into the K8 dispatch. `VLLM_EXL3_PREFILL_CAPACITY`
is bounded to the scheduler's 512-token batch and eager mode avoids an
unqualified graph path. B12X sparse MLA and the rest of the qualified GLM-5.3
stack remain enabled.

The engine exposed **6,610,733 logical KV tokens**, or 14.41 maximum-length
requests. Per-GPU profiling reported 78.94–78.97 GiB weights plus non-torch,
2.25 GiB peak activations, zero graph memory, and 7.10–7.14 GiB KV.

### Correctness and context

Two independent 448K trials each built a tokenizer-exact 449,461-token document
and retrieved all three facts, in 170.775 and 175.086 seconds. Short and strict
structured-output checks still passed after the long-context stress. The common
458,752-token K6/K8 cap is a correctness boundary, not an extrapolation from KV
capacity.

### Measured throughput

Unique-prefix prefill, one request, no prefix reuse:

| prompt | tok/s |
|---:|---:|
| 8K | 2,684 |
| 32K | 2,825 |
| 64K | 2,938 |
| 128K | 2,986 |

Aggregate target-only decode (`MTP_TOKENS=0`), eight requests per level:

| input context | C1 tok/s | C4 tok/s | C8 tok/s |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 | 10.29 | 38.79 | 75.66 |
| 32K | 8.42 | 23.43 | 28.46 |
| 128K | 5.42 | 12.05 | 13.25 |

All 72 requests completed without failure, preemption, or prefix reuse. These
are measurements from one four-GPU PCIe host, not guarantees for other topology,
clock, thermal, driver, storage, or request mixes.

### K8 versus the K6 production default

K8 lowers panel KLD from K6's 0.013723 to 0.012384. After subtracting the common
BF16/runtime floor, its excess over control is 0.000878 nats against K6's
0.002209 (no residual ratio is quoted — P1-05). The
cost is about 77 GB / 30% more checkpoint bytes, about 15.2 GiB more non-KV
memory per GPU, and about 14.4 GiB less KV per GPU. K6 is 5.3–7.3× faster at
short context and 8.3–24.4× faster when the measured 32K/128K prefill cost is
included. K8 is the fidelity-first option; K6 remains the production default.

### Docker Compose

Prerequisites: Linux x86-64, four visible RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, NVIDIA
driver ≥ 590.48.01 / CUDA 13.2 compatibility, the NVIDIA Container Toolkit,
and roughly 400 GiB free persistent storage for the checkpoint plus caches.
PCIe P2P on this card family requires NVIDIA's open kernel modules; see the
[RTX 6000 Pro multi-GPU notes](https://github.com/brandonmmusic-max/rtx6kpro).

retrieval verified`. API: `http://HOST:8000/v1`; dashboard:
`http://HOST:1111`. The served model name is `GLM-5.3-Flash-K8`.

```bash

  -d '{"model":"GLM-5.3-Flash-K8","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly READY"}],"max_tokens":256}'
```

Do not replace only the checkpoint path in another vLLM command. The profile,
parent digest, runtime overlays, quantization, attention backend, DCP topology,
KV calibration, scheduler, and eager execution mode are one qualified contract.
