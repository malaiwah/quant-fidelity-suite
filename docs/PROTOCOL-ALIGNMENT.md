# Protocol alignment: brandonmusic's proposed community standard vs ours

**Date:** 2026-08-29
**His standard:** `eval/kld/` in `huggingface.co/brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw`,
governed by `kld quantization fidelity report.md`
(sha256 `692ff9e50bc70e716f1a94f1d9a4f3fb2c6d797f639dc8da84b17b069a20b9fc`)
**Our side:** `github.com/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-suite`, `registry/`, `bin/jointstd/`
**Our frozen protocol:** `registry/protocol/glm53-joint-kld-protocol.v1.json`
file `80df521eb46fba68538dd90aa3f2baf22b1e440b8b560555646ff9bbeb35961b`,
scoring `20ea68c0c730a9d2444148b234a610a5821a50dfa9980e2446c02723317b5e98`

**Historical snapshot, corrected 2026-09-07.** Upstream source descriptions
and test counts are those inspected for the original campaign, not a current
remote check. The dated mathematical/statistical corrections below govern
interpretation; frozen receipts and metric values are preserved.

Short version: the table below has eighteen rows. **He is ahead on eight of
them and we took his design on all eight** — rows 6-13, which are the core of
the standard. Four rows we already had under another name. Five are ours with no
equivalent on his side. Three are genuine divergences (padded columns §3, the
clean scope §4, floors and subtraction §7). **Correction, 2026-09-07:**
the padding study is synthetic on one real teacher window, not a universal
bound; subtraction and interval interpretation are qualified below.

Historical test counts below record the original investigation, not fresh
validation. Reproducing empirical tensor work needs its named inputs; reading
committed receipts alone does not re-execute their experiments.

## 1. Element-by-element

Legend: **ADOPTED** — his is better, we took it. **EQUIVALENT** — we already had
it under another name. **DIVERGENT** — we differ, with a measured reason.
**OURS** — we have it, he does not.

| # | Element | His | Ours before | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Direction and units: KL(teacher‖student), nats | yes | yes | EQUIVALENT | `metric.direction = reference_to_candidate` on all 66 registry rows |
| 2 | Full-vocabulary FP32 teacher logits | yes | yes | EQUIVALENT | same teacher artifact, same `teacher_receipt_sha256 2ae08117…` |
| 3 | FP32+ log-softmax, FP64 accumulation | fp64 both | fp64 both | EQUIVALENT | `estimator.accumulation_dtype = float64` |
| 4 | **Padded lm_head columns masked on both sides** | yes | **no** | **DIVERGENT — studied synthetically, §3** | masking policy disclosed; ≈1e-10 only in studied synthetic shared-head perturbations, not actual all-row masking |
| 5 | Frozen token ids, published hashes, teacher-forced, bs=1, eager, no MTP/spec/prefix-cache | yes | yes | EQUIVALENT | our panel record pins the same `token_ids_sha256` values |
| 6 | **R0 canary: self-KLD exactly 0.0 AND a one-position shift explodes** | half — the shift half is a synthetic unit test, not a session gate | self-KLD only | **ADOPTED, and extended** — §5.1 | `bin/joint-standard canary`; 5 FIRE cases in the selftest |
| 7 | **≥3 cold runs, report `sigma_run` beside the statistical SE, combine in quadrature** | yes | run means recorded, sigma never reported | **ADOPTED** — §5.4 | `uncertainty.sigma_run`, `.se_total`, invariant JOINT-002/003 |
| 8 | **Window-clustered block bootstrap, BCa, B=5000** | yes | `uncertainty.method = "none"` on **all 16 of our rows on his two panels** (39 of our 60 rows elsewhere already carried a context-cluster bootstrap) | **ADOPTED** — §5.3 | 12 rows now carry a BCa interval; 16/16 of his published endpoints reproduced |
| 9 | **Percentile only with ≥100 exceedances; never compare max across different N** | yes | not enforced | **ADOPTED** — §5.5 | `percentile_guard`, plus a refusal our data needs (§5.5) |
| 10 | **Per-domain and per-position tables** | yes | computed in every kld-report, never published | **ADOPTED** — §5.2 | historical domain means retained; one document/domain does not support domain population inference |
| 11 | **Calibration-overlap scan: document hash AND 13-gram** | yes | document/shingle scan on OUR panels, none on his | **ADOPTED** — §4 | our scan reproduces his 25/25 exactly |
| 12 | **One frozen protocol file, hash in every output** | yes — but it broke, §6 | no protocol file at all | **ADOPTED, with a fix** — §6 | two hashes: file + scoring-subset |
| 13 | **Paired differences + McNemar, not overlapping marginal CIs** | yes | paired per-window t-interval | **ADOPTED, qualified** — §5.6 | arithmetic reproduction is not inference validation; independent units and actual pair predicates still required |
| 14 | Measured BF16 **control** and descriptive excess (formerly "attributable error", P1-05) | subtraction discouraged | yes | **OURS — qualified, §7** | +1.4% versus −9%/−16% is observed scope sensitivity, not causal isolation or general stability |
| 15 | Schema-enforced registry with mechanical refusals | no | yes | **OURS** | 90 invariants, 8 new; CMP-003 caught a real error in this very work (§4.3) |
| 16 | Lane separation (`same_stack` / `cross_stack`) | no field | yes, on the teacher-vs-student axis only | **OURS, but narrower than we first claimed — §8** | our two BF16 floors, 0.011506 vs 0.012712, same panel and teacher. It does **not** separate his 0.0305 from his 0.024555: that is a pipeline difference and `pipeline_ref` is not a key input |
| 17 | Multi-format decode surfaces (TR3/EXL3, dione, MLX, GGUF, NVFP4) | EXL3 + NVFP4 | 5 surfaces | OURS | `engines/tools/stream_score.py --source` |
| 18 | Threshold for the overlap scan justified | bare `0.05` literal, no sensitivity analysis | n/a — his scanner, his threshold | **CONTRIBUTION BACK on row 11, §4.2** | the published means swing 15% across plausible thresholds |

**Where he is plainly ahead and we simply took his design:** rows 6-13. That is
the core of the standard. Our contribution to those rows is implementation and
validation, not design, and the protocol file says so. Row 18 is not a column of
ours either — the scanner and the threshold are his; the sensitivity sweep is
something we hand back to it.

## 3. Divergence 1 — the padded lm_head columns

GLM-5.3-Flash stores 154,880 lm_head columns for a 154,856-token vocabulary.
His protocol masks the 24 padded columns out of both sides before the
log-softmax. The historical unmasked scorer (now `engines/tools/kld_report.py::_token_kld`) takes a
log-softmax over the full last dimension.

We did not argue about the size of this, but we could not measure it directly
either, and the distinction matters.

**What is real and what is simulated.** We downloaded his teacher window
`final-0000` (1,268,157,840 B, sha256 `9f49af1b…`, verified). The *teacher* logits
below — including every number about the padded columns themselves — are read
straight out of that tensor. The *students* are not. Measuring a real
masked-vs-unmasked delta for K6 or FP8 needs K6 and FP8 student logits on his
panel, which needs a GPU run we did not do. So we reconstructed the 4096-dim
hidden states from his teacher tensor by least squares against a real
`lm_head.weight` (relative rms residual 1.6e-3) and built thirteen **synthetic**
students on top of them, spanning mean KLD 4.8e-5 to 1.0 nats and tuned so that
four of them land near our published values. They are a sensitivity study,
not a re-measurement of our quants. The table's row labels name the configuration
each synthetic student imitates, not a re-run of that row.

**The padded columns are not dead.** Their rows have norm ≈ 0.4795 against a
typical real-row norm of 1.21, and they are mutually cosine-0.999998 — one
untrained direction, repeated 24 times. Their logits run −4.19 to −0.46 against
a mean top-1 logit of 19.72, so they hold about 1.6e-8 of the probability mass.

**The measured effect of masking** (ten of the thirteen; the three omitted are
higher-KLD checks at 0.030, 0.300 and 0.999 nats, whose deltas are +2.16e-10,
+1.61e-09 and +3.07e-09 — the same 3e-9-to-7e-9 relative band):

| synthetic student configuration | unmasked mean KLD | masked − unmasked | relative |
|---|---|---|---|
| BF16 floor (shared native head) | 0.011512590648 | +8.56e-11 | +7.44e-09 |
| K6 tr3-6bpw (shared native head) | 0.013733076402 | +1.02e-10 | +7.40e-09 |
| official FP8 (shared native head) | 0.020605959271 | +1.51e-10 | +7.31e-09 |
| Dione Q4 (shared native head) | 0.027261644072 | +1.97e-10 | +7.24e-09 |
| RTN per-row int8 head | 0.000048287080 | +4.45e-13 | +9.21e-09 |
| RTN per-row int6 head (stock EXL3) | 0.000997485627 | +4.60e-12 | +4.61e-09 |
| RTN per-row int4 head | 0.016038835491 | +9.90e-11 | +6.17e-09 |
| group-128 affine 6b (GGUF/MLX-like) | 0.000348939975 | +4.69e-12 | +1.34e-08 |
| group-128 affine 4b (MLX 4-bit-like) | 0.005698363496 | +6.83e-11 | +1.20e-08 |
| **adversarial global-scale int4 head** | 0.183019918220 | **−5.12e-08** | −2.80e-07 |

The last row is the stress case: a deliberately bad head quantization that
shifts the padded logits by +2.1 nats on average and 4.2 nats at worst, and
blows the KLD to 0.183. Even there the masking changes the answer by 5e-8 nats.

**The load-bearing result is the teacher-side one, and it does not depend on the
simulation.** The padded columns hold ~1.6e-8 of the teacher's probability mass
on a real window of his real teacher. The masked and unmasked log-partition
functions therefore differ by ~1.6e-8 on the teacher side. Writing `e_p` and
`e_q` for the padded mass on each side, the masked-minus-unmasked delta is
exactly

```
    KL * e_p/(1-e_p)  -  D_pad/(1-e_p)  -  log(1-e_p) + log(1-e_q)
    where  D_pad = e_p*log(e_p/e_q) + e_p*KL(pbar||qbar)
```

**Correction, 2026-09-07 — no universal padding bound.** A shared head matrix
does not imply shared hidden states, logits, normalization, padded mass
(`e_q = e_p`), or padded conditional distribution. In particular the
`log(1-e_q)` term is not controlled by the teacher's small `e_p`: it diverges
as the student's padded mass approaches one. Even equal padded masses do not
make `D_pad` zero unless the padded conditional distributions also agree.

The receipt itself refutes the old shared-head equality: synthetic K6 has
`Pm_mean = 1.6021273967482534e-8` versus
`Qm_mean = 1.554894865370624e-8`. The real teacher's mean padded mass is
1.6006386701531373e-8, but its maximum on that window is
1.2298122759907192e-6; the mean is not a per-position cap.

The thirteen synthetic students demonstrate small masking effects **only for
the studied perturbations on final-0000**. The teacher's measured ~1.6e-8 padded
mass and the synthetic table above remain valid historical evidence; they do
not bound arbitrary students or establish actual K6/K8/FP8 masking deltas.

The former table headed "masked equivalent" is withdrawn. Its values were
manufactured by transferring synthetic deltas to published full-panel means,
not by masking real student logits on all scored rows. Historical unmasked
measurements remain unchanged:

| published row | as published (unmasked) | actual masked equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| BF16 floor (streaming) | 0.011505922619330299 | not measured |
| K8 tr3-8bpw | 0.012384191023436866 | not measured |
| BF16 floor (cross-stack) | 0.012711599817250709 | not measured |
| K6 streaming | 0.013714888822596553 | not measured |
| K6 sealed | 0.013723384665701147 | not measured |
| official FP8 | 0.020615254540417995 | not measured |

Masking policy must be disclosed; adopting masking changes the estimator and
does not silently correct or re-seal old receipts. The protocol file's
`padded_column_policy: mask_both_sides` is not evidence that every historical
scorer applied it. It is not currently a comparability-key input; equality of
that key is only necessary, and the actual estimator policies must be checked
before ranking. No claim that masking can never affect comparability remains.

**Reproducibility gap, now closed.** An earlier draft of this section shipped
without its script or its receipt — the reconstruction and the synthetic students
were run out of tree and only the results were written down. By the standard this
document argues for, that was not good enough. Both are now committed:

- `bin/padded_column_study.py` — one script, inputs named on the command line,
  seven stages, refusing on a teacher window whose sha256 is not the published one.
- `docs/joint-standard/padded-column/padded-column-study.json` — the full run
  (all thirteen students, 384 s).
- `docs/joint-standard/padded-column/teacher-side-reproduction.json` — the
  load-bearing half on its own (7 s), which needs **only his 1.27 GB window** and
  no `lm_head`. Anyone can re-derive every teacher-side number in this section
  from his published dataset alone.

`bin/check_doc_numbers.py` re-derives this section's numbers from that receipt on
every run, so the table and the receipt cannot drift apart again.

Two honest notes on the re-run. The six **quantized-head** students reproduce the
out-of-tree originals *bit for bit* — those are the stress cases the argument
rests on. The four **shared-head** rows differ in the 5th–7th digit of the
unmasked mean, because the committed script brackets the noise bisection over
`[1e-4, 3.0]` where the original capped at 0.2; the same wider bracket is why the
Dione Q4 row, which the original had to drop, is present here. The quantity that
matters — the masked-minus-unmasked delta — is unchanged at every row.

## 4. Divergence 2 — the calibration-clean scope

### 4.1 We reproduced his scan exactly

We fetched the 665 published token arrays (5.53 MB) and re-ran his 13-gram
overlap scan with an independent implementation:

```
$ bin/joint-standard overlap-scan --panel panel.json --arrays arrays/ \
    --expect his/window_selection.json
cross-check against window_selection.json: 25 windows, 0 mismatches
```

All 25 windows match his published `shared_13gram_count` and
`shared_13gram_fraction` exactly. The committed result is
`registry/protocol/window-selection.brandonmusic-final25.json`.

His finding stands and it is the single most important thing in his standard:
**`document_id_in_calibration` is `false` for all 25 windows** — document-level
separation is clean — **and six of them still share 37–39 % of their 13-grams
with calibration-role windows.** Document-hash dedup alone does not catch it.

One detail worth spelling out, because it is easy to get wrong: the denominator
is the **deduplicated** gram set. An axis4 window has only ~710 distinct 13-grams
out of 2036 slices, because that corpus repeats itself. Using 2036 would report
13 % instead of 38 %.

**The excluded set is not one domain.** Six axis4 windows, plus `final-0021`
(axis2_legal, 7.1 %) and `final-0022` (axis3_code_agentic, 5.8 %). A 19-window
whole-axis4 drop is a *different* scope and gives materially different answers.

### 4.2 The 0.05 threshold is unjustified, and it matters

His threshold is a bare `frac > 0.05` literal in `cli.py` with no published
sensitivity analysis. Here is the analysis. Window counts first:

| threshold | 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.04 | **0.05** | 0.06 | 0.075 | 0.10 | 0.20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| windows kept | 10 | 13 | 16 | **17** | 18 | 19 | 19 | 19 |

The *window count* has a plateau at 19 for any threshold in [0.075, 0.20]. The
*numbers* do not. Relative move of each published mean from the full 25-window panel:

| threshold | n | K6 sealed | K8 stream | FP8 x-stack | BF16 floor x-stack | his 4bpw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.20 / 0.10 / 0.075 | 19 | −5.04 % | −5.23 % | +2.62 % | −6.06 % | +6.65 % |
| 0.06 | 18 | −12.20 % | −12.88 % | −2.61 % | −12.43 % | +1.69 % |
| **0.05 (his)** | **17** | **−14.91 %** | **−12.55 %** | **−9.46 %** | **−16.24 %** | **+1.61 %** |
| 0.04 | 16 | −10.85 % | −8.39 % | −5.23 % | −12.24 % | +6.39 % |
| 0.03 | 13 | −11.02 % | −8.04 % | −11.40 % | −12.95 % | +8.71 % |
| 0.02 | 10 | −5.91 % | −4.29 % | −7.00 % | −10.25 % | +18.19 % |

Moving the threshold from 0.075 to 0.05 triples the size of the correction to
K6. The highest overlap among the retained windows is 4.75 % (`final-0014`), so
0.05 separates cleanly — but only just, and nothing about 0.05 is derived.
**This is the first thing worth a joint decision.**

One result is *nearly* robust across every threshold: **his 4bpw row moves up at
all eight thresholds, and three of our four rows (K6, K8, BF16 floor) move down
at all eight.** So the sign flip between contributors is not an artifact of 0.05.

**The exception is our cross-stack FP8 row, and the table above shows it.** FP8
moves down at the five tightest thresholds (−7.00 %, −11.40 %, −5.23 %, −9.46 %,
−2.61 %) and *up* by +2.62 % at 0.075 and every looser threshold.

Exactly two windows separate the 17-window scope from the 19-window one:
`final-0021` (axis2_legal, 7.1 % overlap) and `final-0022` (axis3_code_agentic,
5.8 %). FP8 scores 0.040566 and 0.044075 on them — more than twice its clean17
mean of 0.018665 — so putting them back lifts FP8 to 0.021155, which is *above*
its 25-window mean of 0.020615. Every other row has the same two windows above
its clean17 mean too, but not far enough above its panel25 mean to cross over
(K6 reaches 0.013031 against a panel25 of 0.013723, still −5.04 %). One
contributor row therefore does change sign inside the window-count plateau, which
is one more reason the threshold deserves a joint decision rather than a default.

### 4.3 Both scopes, published side by side

Recomputed from our own published per-window arrays. No GPU, no re-measurement:
every value is the equal-weight mean of exactly the windows its scope names, and
`registry/tools/registry_joint_check.py` re-derives all twelve to prove it.

| row | scope | mean | BCa 95 % | SE (window-clustered) | deff | sigma_run |

Scope deltas: K6 sealed **−14.91 %**, K6 streaming −14.87 %, K8 −12.55 %,
FP8 −9.46 %, BF16 cross-stack floor −16.24 %, **his 4bpw +1.61 %**.

**Two rows cannot be recomputed at all.** The BF16 *streaming* floor
(0.011505922619) and the Dione Q4 (0.027262784815) have scalar-only receipts —
run means and a tokenwise digest, no per-window array. Their registry rows now
say so in `notes` rather than quietly having no clean sibling.

**The registry caught a real error here.** The first version of these rows sat
under the parent panel's comparability key, and invariant CMP-003 refused them:
*"shares comparability key … with rows scoring a different number of positions."*
That is correct. A different window set is a different panel, so `clean17` now
has its own derived panel record (`panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25-clean17`)
and its own derived reference, which makes a clean17-vs-panel25 table
structurally impossible rather than merely discouraged.

### 4.4 Do the conclusions survive?

> **Correction, 2026-08-31 (P1-15/P1-16, peer review).** The table below is
> **descriptive of this fixed panel**, not population inference. The panel's 25
> windows derive from **four source documents** (7/6/6/6; clean17: three,
> 7/5/5), so the window-level sign tests and BCa intervals treat

Paired per-window comparisons, BCa on the differences, on both scopes —
**descriptive of this panel; the inferential unit is the document (above)**:

| comparison | scope | mean A | mean B | ratio | 95 % CI of A−B (BCa) | A better in | sign p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| K6 − K8 | panel25 | 0.013723385 | 0.012384191 | 1.108 | [+0.000695, +0.002330] | 5/25 | 4.1e-03 |
| K6 − K8 | clean17 | 0.011677286 | 0.010829420 | 1.078 | [+0.000153, +0.001573] | 4/17 | 4.9e-02 |
| K6 − FP8 | panel25 | 0.013723385 | 0.020615255 | 0.666 | [−0.009982, −0.004872] | 25/25 | 6.0e-08 |
| K6 − FP8 | clean17 | 0.011677286 | 0.018665327 | 0.626 | [−0.010506, −0.004798] | 17/17 | 1.5e-05 |
| K8 − FP8 | clean17 | 0.010829420 | 0.018665327 | 0.580 | [−0.011966, −0.005493] | 17/17 | 1.5e-05 |

**Correction, 2026-09-07.** These historical mixed-design contrasts are not a
codec ranking. The K6−K8 rows use sealed K6 versus streaming K8; the FP8 and
author-reported 4bpw contrasts additionally change runtime/pipeline. The
same-lane `paired.K6stream-vs-K8` receipt supports a finite-panel ordering,
not a population quality claim. Document-level tests require explicit
independent-document assumptions; four selected documents (three in clean17)
do not calibrate population confidence. Neither narrow paired intervals nor
overlapping marginal intervals cure a design mismatch.

### 4.5 Historical excess over control on the clean scope

The cross-stack FP8 and BF16-control rows permit the following descriptive
subtraction on each named scope. Matching a lane label alone does not prove
a valid causal control or satisfy the full pair predicate:

| scope | FP8 | BF16 control | excess over control | historical window BCa 95 % | raw/control ratio (descriptive) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| panel25 | 0.020615255 | 0.012711600 | **0.007903655** | [+0.005823, +0.011253] | 1.622 |
| clean17 | 0.018665327 | 0.010647639 | **0.008017687** | [+0.005663, +0.012022] | 1.753 |

**Correction, 2026-09-07.** The difference moves +1.44 % while the two inputs
move −9.46 % and −16.24 %. That is an observed sensitivity result, not evidence
that subtraction isolates quantization or generalizes across scope changes.
`KL(P||Q_quant) − KL(P||Q_control) = E_P[log Q_control − log Q_quant]`
is not a KL divergence, can be negative, and retains interactions with the
reference and runtime.

The streaming BF16 control is scalar-only, so no clean17 K6/K8 excess can be
recomputed. The former 2.52× residual-ratio headline is withdrawn, not a
standing panel25 quality claim. No raw published metric has been rewritten.

### 4.6 Historical domain means, not domain quality rankings

| domain | K6 sealed | K8 stream | FP8 x-stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| axis1_general (7 w) | 0.011739694 | 0.011367036 | 0.019568765 |
| axis2_legal (5 w) | 0.011448683 | 0.010324227 | 0.020672762 |
| axis3_code_agentic (5 w) | 0.011818519 | 0.010581951 | 0.015393078 |

**Correction, 2026-09-07.** Cross-stack FP8/K6 ratios, their 1.39× spread and
the "legal is worst" quality conclusion are withdrawn. Each domain here is
one source document. These are measured means of selected windows, not
independent-document domain estimates. Calibration overlap may matter, but
these uncontrolled contrasts do not identify its causal effect or direction.

## 5. What we adopted, and how each piece is validated

`bin/selftest_joint_standard.py`, run with his `kld_eval` on `PYTHONPATH` and the
real panel/teacher available: **112 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**. On a stock
`python3` with none of that: **106 passed, 0 failed, 6 skipped** (the skips are
the oracle and real-data cases, and they announce themselves).

### 5.1 R0 canary — both halves, and it fires

His `cmd_canary_loader` implements R0-a (self-KLD exactly 0.0) plus a
teacher-top1-vs-realized band. R0-b, the one-position shift, exists only as
`tests/test_kld.py::test_one_position_shift_is_entropy_scale` on V=512 random
logits — it never runs against the real teacher inside a session. His own
proposed standard names it as part of R0. That gap is the concrete thing we can
hand back.

Ours runs both, against whatever logits it is given, and refuses on failure:

```
  PASS  R0 passes on a well-formed teacher    self-KLD 0.0 both scopes; shift 12.418 nats = 4.7x entropy
  PASS  FIRE R0-a: one nudged logit out of 524288        R0-a: 1 of 256 positions have non-zero KLD…
  PASS  FIRE R0-a: deliberately misaligned pair          R0-a: 255 of 255 positions have non-zero KLD…
  PASS  FIRE R0-b: near-constant rows pass R0-a at 0.0 and still fail   R0-b: one-position shift gave mean 3.54289e-15 nats…
  PASS  FIRE R0-c: teacher-top1 agreement outside the band
  PASS  self-KLD is exactly 0.0 in BOTH scopes with padded columns present
  PASS  ORACLE: kld_eval.score_window == our fp64 kernel   max|d|=2.67e-16
  PASS  REAL teacher window passes R0        shift 7.903 nats vs entropy 1.770 (4.5x)
```

The R0-b FIRE case is the interesting one. It hands the canary a teacher whose
rows barely differ — what a left-on prefix cache looks like. That teacher passes
R0-a at **exactly 0.0** and is still broken, and only R0-b catches it. That is
the concrete reason his standard is right to name both halves, and the reason we
wired the second half into the session gate rather than leaving it in tests.

On his real teacher window: self-KLD 0.0 in both the masked and unmasked scopes,
one-position shift 7.903 nats against a mean teacher entropy of 1.770 — 4.5×.

### 5.2 Per-domain stratification

Our `kld-report.json` has carried a `per_domain` block all along; we simply never
published it. Now every enriched registry row carries `by_domain` with a
window-clustered SE and an interval, and invariant JOINT-006 requires the
per-domain positions to sum to `measurement_scope.scored_positions`.

**Correction, 2026-09-07 — simulation coverage is not population confidence.**
The historical per-domain intervals used 5–7 windows as resampling units.
In fitted-lognormal simulations (4000 replications per cell), BCa achieved
81.3% coverage (81.5% at B=20000), and delta-t-log achieved 92.0%.
Those numbers describe the assumed synthetic populations and fitted cells,
not coverage for new real source documents. They cannot calibrate domain
inference when each domain contains only one document. Nor does marginal
undercoverage determine a false domain-separation rate. No theorem says
95% coverage is impossible at five observations; validity depends on the
sampling/model assumptions. Historical endpoints and simulation receipts stay
unchanged; current commentary must label their studied scope.

### 5.3 Window block bootstrap with BCa

Textbook BCa (Efron & Tibshirani): percentile endpoints, `z0` from the bootstrap
mass below the observed statistic, acceleration from a leave-one-window-out
jackknife. Three backends, and the receipt names which one ran — `kld_eval`
(his), `numpy` (ours, driving PCG64 with his seed and draw pattern), `stdlib`
(ours, no dependencies).

Known-answer, against his four published analysis receipts, from his 25
per-window means alone:

```
  PASS  published percentile CI exl3/selected   [0.022341151367, 0.036971250314] max|d|=6.9e-18
  PASS  published BCa CI exl3/selected          [0.022653106208, 0.037476289386] max|d|=3.5e-18
  PASS  published percentile CI exl3/panel      [0.024646838372, 0.037044329848] max|d|=6.9e-18
  PASS  published BCa CI exl3/panel             [0.024964506716, 0.037418759476] max|d|=6.9e-18
  PASS  published percentile CI nvfp4/selected  [0.036804664652, 0.064325111657] max|d|=2.8e-17
  PASS  published BCa CI nvfp4/selected         [0.038010260038, 0.066435042806] max|d|=2.1e-17
  PASS  published percentile CI nvfp4/panel     [0.038471793958, 0.061625142006] max|d|=6.9e-18
  PASS  published BCa CI nvfp4/panel            [0.039814482413, 0.063889491867] max|d|=1.4e-17
  PASS  ORACLE: kld_eval.block_bootstrap == ours   max|d|=6.94e-18
```

Sixteen endpoints to within one ULP, on a different OS with much newer numpy —
and then the same input through his own code, agreeing to 7e-18. His four
`se_clustered_window` values reproduce exactly too.

Why per-window means suffice: every window is exactly 2047 scored positions, so
the token-weighted mean of a window resample equals the plain mean of the
resampled window means. Our receipts carry per-window means but not per-token
arrays; that equivalence is what makes all 60 existing rows analysable with no
GPU. It is asserted in the checker, not assumed.

The **design effect** this exposes is the practical payoff:
`deff_window` runs 21–29 on our rows and 74–105 on his 4bpw. The naive SE
understates by 4.6× to 10×, so anyone reading `std/sqrt(N)` off this panel would
be reading an interval five to ten times too narrow. To be precise about our own
record: we never published a naive SE — on his panels we published **no interval
at all**, on all sixteen rows, which is its own failure and the one row 8 fixes.
Elsewhere in the registry 39 of 60 rows already carried a context-cluster
bootstrap; those were never the problem.

### 5.4 sigma_run and quadrature

```
  PASS  sigma_run exl3_3cold_25w (3 runs)        got 0.000000000000e+00
  PASS  sigma_run nvfp4_2cold_25w (2 runs)       got 3.332041111285e-04
  PASS  two-run sigma carries its 1-dof flag
  PASS  2-run sigma == |delta|/sqrt(2)
  PASS  his published SE_total 6.00e-3           got 6.000156395e-03
  PASS  sigma_run/SE ratio inside his 0.20 gate  ratio=0.05562
  PASS  FIRE: sigma_run/SE = 0.5 trips the 0.20 gate
```

One honest note back to him: his headline NVFP4 `sigma_run = 3.33e-4` is an
**n = 2** estimate. `std(ddof=1)` over two values is exactly `|Δ|/√2` — one
degree of freedom, and we verified it is exactly that. He *did* run three cold
NVFP4 runs, but only on a 3-window subset, where sigma is 1.40e-3, four times
larger. Our implementation flags any two-run sigma in the receipt note.

On clean-scope rows we drop `determinism.run_means` (they are panel-scope means
and would be wrong) and quote `sigma_run = 0.0` **only** where the runs are
bitwise identical — because bitwise identity implies identical per-run means on
*every* subset of windows. Anything else is not recoverable from panel-scope run
means, so it is omitted rather than guessed. Invariant JOINT-003 enforces that a
zero sigma requires bitwise evidence.

### 5.5 Percentile-exceedance guard, plus one refusal our data needs

The guard reproduces his behaviour: at N = 34,799 it admits p90/p95/p99 and
suppresses p99.9 (34.8 exceedances).

**A micro-finding to flag:** his `n * (1.0 - q) >= MIN_EXCEEDANCES` is wrong by
one ULP at an exact boundary. `1 - 0.9` is `0.09999999999999998`, so n = 1000,
q = 0.90 evaluates to 99.99999999999998 and the guard suppresses a quantile with
exactly 100 exceedances. Ours uses a tolerance. This changes **no** decision in
his campaign — his panel sizes are 34,799 and 51,175 — but it is a real edge.

**And a refusal he does not need but we do.** Our published receipts carry
per-window percentiles, not per-token arrays. A panel p95 is *not* a function of
per-window p95s, so `guard_pooled_percentiles` returns a refusal rather than a
number:

> pooled token percentiles are not derivable from per-window summaries; a panel
> p95 is not a function of per-window p95s

Exact pooled percentiles require per-token values or lossless order-statistic
information, not just per-window n/sums/variances/quantiles. Such summaries
help recompute means but cannot recover the missing pooled tails.

### 5.6 McNemar

Continuity-corrected chi-square plus the exact binomial, with no scipy. Hand
check first, arithmetic written into the assertion:

> A right / B wrong = 12, B right / A wrong = 3.
> χ² = (|12−3| − 1)² / 15 = 64/15 = 4.2666666666666666
> exact two-sided binomial = 2·(1+15+105+455)/2¹⁵ = 1152/32768 = **0.03515625**

Then his five published p-values, reproduced from the published cell counts:

```
  PASS  published p reproduced: nvfp4-vs-exl3 clean   963/1629  p=5.440149e-39  rel=1.3e-15
  PASS  published p reproduced: nvfp4-vs-exl3 panel  1273/2120  p=8.570506e-48  rel=1.4e-14
  PASS  published p reproduced: paired_blockm         459/485   p=4.158279e-01  rel=5.3e-16
  PASS  published p reproduced: paired_chunk          477/443   p=2.766049e-01  rel=1.1e-14
  PASS  published p reproduced: paired_kv             525/467   p=7.033428e-02  rel=2.4e-15
```

Our own rows cannot carry McNemar yet: it needs per-position top-1 agreement for
both runs, and per-window means cannot supply a contingency table. The `paired`
verb says exactly that instead of inventing one.

---

## 6. The "one frozen protocol file" rule, and a fix for the way it slipped

His rule is right. It did not survive his own campaign. Three distinct
`protocol_sha256` values appear across his published receipts:

| hash | stamped into |
|---|---|
| `53e165dd…` | `teacher_manifest`, `window_selection`, `run-run1/2/3/3b`, `run-r0a/b/c`, `r5_sweep_r0*` |
| `8e80e8e1…` | `analysis-run1-{selected,panel}`, `kld_card.{md,json}`, `r5_sweep_cold3`, `paired_kvfp8` |
| `4d1d91ad…` | all NVFP4 receipts — **and the file currently published** |

He discloses two of the three transitions himself. The mechanism is visible in
`scripts/make_protocol.py`: the generator writes `governing_document` as a plain
string reading "NOT FOUND", while the published file has it as a dict carrying
the report's sha256 and also carries a `student_nvfp4:` block the generator never
writes. The file was hand-edited twice after generation, to add identity
metadata. **Neither edit changed a scoring rule**, and yet the EXL3 headline and
the NVFP4 headline it is compared against carry different protocol hashes, and no
published receipt except the NVFP4 ones carries the hash of the file now on the
Hub. (One receipt, `r0_student_canary.json`, carries no `protocol_sha256` at all —
it is written outside `_write_json()`.)

That is precisely the failure the rule exists to prevent, and it is not
carelessness — it is what happens when the hash covers bytes that include
identity metadata.

We hit the same problem the moment we wrote a protocol file of our own, which is
why the fix below is a proposal and not a criticism.

**The fix: hash the scoring-relevant subset, and publish both hashes.**

- `protocol_file_sha256` — sha256 of the raw bytes. His rule, unchanged,
  byte-level provenance.
- `protocol_scoring_sha256` — sha256 of a canonical JSON serialisation
  (`sort_keys`, `separators=(',',':')`, ASCII, UTF-8) of exactly
  `{scoring, selection, uncertainty, determinism, canary_r0, lane, reporting}`.

Matching scoring hashes establishes only the scoring-policy component of
comparability, not the full pair predicate. A file hash that moved while the
scoring hash held records a provenance change. Historical selftest evidence:

```
  PASS  identity-only edit: file hash MOVES, scoring hash HOLDS  80df521eb46f -> 1c64ad3aada8
  PASS  a scoring edit MOVES the scoring hash                    20ea68c0c730 -> cb8f78c4dde8
```

And the stamp is enforced, not merely written: `require_stamp` refuses an
unstamped receipt, a foreign schema, and a stale scoring hash, and every verb of
`bin/joint-standard` runs it before writing anything.

## 7. Divergence 3 — floors and subtraction

§5.3 of his report ranks "Subtraction (not recommended)" third and says *"Do not
publish subtracted numbers."* Our excess-over-control framing (formerly
"attributable error", renamed 2026-08-31 per P1-05) **is** a subtraction. This is a real disagreement and we are not going to paper over it.

Our position, and what we changed:

1. **The subtraction is strictly same-lane and same-scope.** Two different rules
   do that work, and it is worth naming them correctly: **BIAS-006** refuses a
   floor whose *lane* differs from the row's, and that is all BIAS-006 does.
   The *scope* refusal comes from **BIAS-002** (a floor must share the row's
   comparability key) now that `clean17` is a separate panel with its own key,
   backed by the joint checker's rule that one comparability key holds exactly
   one `scope_name`. We never publish a subtracted number without the raw row
   and the floor beside it.
2. **His §5.3 item 1 is our BIAS-006, independently arrived at.** "Isolate and
   gate … measure the engine's floor … report the decomposition" is what the
   floor rows are for. The disagreement is narrower than it looks: it is about
   whether the *difference* may be quoted as a headline, not about whether the
   floor should be measured.
3. **Scope sensitivity, not causal validation.** The +1.44 % residual change
   in §4.5 is descriptive. The two raw inputs moving −9.46 % and −16.24 %
   does not establish a generally stable or quantization-only decomposition.
4. **The full comparison contract still applies.** Same lane, scope, teacher
   and panel are necessary; source/forward identity, scope policy, replay
   arithmetic and the actual `pair_predicate` must also support the contrast.
   An unknown cross-stack bias direction is legitimate disclosure but does not
   make the row `usable_as_floor`.

Publish raw values and, where the control contract permits it, a clearly
labelled descriptive excess. Population intervals additionally require
provenance-supported independent units and explicit sampling assumptions.
Never present subtraction alone as causal quantization error.

---

## 8. Where the two bodies of evidence line up

Worth stating plainly because collaboration is the point — and worth stating
narrowly, because an earlier draft of this section claimed more than the evidence
carries. Of the three items below, exactly one is a case of our measurements
confirming his. The other two are smaller and are labelled as what they are.

**His engine-path gap is his own result, and it is the strongest argument for
lane discipline that either of us has.** He reports **0.030480** (headline
0.0305) for his 4bpw through the vLLM/b12x serving path, and **0.024555** for
what his `five-cold-run-kld.json` calls the `k4-tp2` packed profile. Both numbers
are his. The panel and teacher are provably identical — the same
`token_panel_receipt_sha256 0beec577…`, the same `teacher_receipt_sha256
2ae08117…`, the same 51,175 positions — and he states twice that it is the same
checkpoint (`RUN_SUMMARY.md`: "Window set and tokenization are byte-identical").
So a ~24 % swing on one checkpoint, one panel, one teacher, from the runtime
alone. That is a real and important finding.

**Three corrections to how we were about to present it.**

1. *It is not our confirmation.* We contributed no measurement to either side.
   Our part is that we ingested one of the two numbers into the registry and
   attached provenance to it. Calling this "our data confirms his" was wrong.
2. *It is not what `stack_relation` encodes.* Our schema defines
   `stack_relation` as whether *reference and candidate logits within one
   measurement* came from the same runtime. Both of his readings are
   teacher-vs-student on one stack; our registry tags the 0.024555 row
   `same_stack`, and a 0.0305 row would very likely be tagged `same_stack` too.
   The axis that separates them is the **pipeline**, and `pipeline_ref` is
   deliberately *not* a comparability key input (CMP-001) — six rows from five
   different pipelines currently share key `cmp--202b717f3219c414`. So our
   registry does not today keep these two numbers apart, and there is no 0.0305
   row in it at all. Saying the field "exists to enforce" this distinction was a
   claim about our tooling that our tooling does not support.
3. *The 0.024555 label is itself unresolved* (§12). Building a headline on it
   before that is settled would repeat the mistake §12 is asking him to fix.

**What our floors genuinely do say.** Our two BF16 floors — 0.011506 measured
same-stack and 0.012712 measured cross-stack, 0.001206 nats apart — are a
same-panel, same-teacher measurement of how much the *estimation path* alone
costs, with nothing quantized. That is our own contribution to the same argument,
on the axis `stack_relation` really does encode. It is adjacent to his result
rather than a confirmation of it, and the honest joint statement is: two
different axes, two independent demonstrations that a fidelity number is a
(model, panel, teacher, stack, pipeline) tuple. **What the standard is missing is
a field for his axis** — see §13.

**Our registry flagged the contamination risk before he scanned, which is a
smaller claim than "predicted".** Our panel record for his panel has carried the
disclosure `weak_contamination_guard` since 2026-08-28, a day before his scan was
published. It says an n-gram scan is missing, not what one would find:

> This panel's only contamination guard is ROLE SEPARATION … No lexical or
> n-gram scan is published … materially weaker than the malaiwah v5 suites,
> which run a 12-word shingle whole-document pre-exclusion and report 0 hits.

He then ran the scan and found 37–39 % overlap in axis4. Flagging the absence of
a check is not the same as predicting its result, and the credit for the finding
is entirely his. What it does show is that the disclosure field was pointed at
the right thing.

**This one is a real mutual confirmation: determinism on two independent lanes.**
EXL3 through the b12x path: 25/25 windows bitwise identical across three cold boots including a
shuffled window order, `sigma_run` exactly 0.0. Our sealed lane: 5 cold runs, one
distinct `tokenwise_kld_sha256`, `sigma_run` exactly 0.0. Two independent stacks,
same conclusion — **determinism is a property of the kernel path, not of the
format**. His NVFP4 counter-example (0/25 bitwise, 93.65 % of tokens changed,
2,652 top-1 flips, a single token swinging 4.69 nats, and yet the mean barely
moving) is the sharpest demonstration of that anyone has published, and it is why
`sigma_run` belongs beside the mean rather than in a footnote.

---

## 9. Calling his harness instead of reimplementing — the explicit evaluation

We were asked to prefer calling his code where it is good and installable. Verb
by verb, from reading the source and running it on this Mac:

**`kld-eval inspect | select | run | sweep-analyze | paired | analyze | card`:
NOT CALLABLE BY US.** Every verb begins with `kld_eval.protocol.load_verified()`,
which refuses to proceed unless five files hash to values recorded in *his*
protocol.yaml, at absolute paths inside his machine:

```
$ python -m kld_eval.cli inspect
kld_eval.protocol.ProtocolMismatch: student config.json: missing at
  /home/brandonmusic/models/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-4bpw/config.json
```

Reusing the CLI means forking his protocol.yaml with our own identity block,
which is authoring a Derivative, not calling his tool.

**`kld_eval.analysis.stats`, `kld_eval.kld.core`, `kld_eval.teacher.token_ngrams`:
CALLABLE, AND WE CALL THEM.** Pure numpy/scipy/pandas/torch, no GPU, no engine,
no HF token, no access to his checkpoint. His 16 unit tests pass unmodified on a
fresh macOS-arm64 venv with libraries far newer than his pins (numpy 2.5.2 vs
1.26.4, scipy 1.18.1 vs 1.17.1, pandas 3.0.5 vs 2.3.3, torch 2.13 vs 2.12):

```

16 passed in 1.26s
```

`bin/jointstd/oracle.py` imports that layer when it is importable and uses it as
the oracle our own implementation is pinned against — bootstrap, clustered SE,
n-gram digests and the per-token kernel, all four cross-checked in the selftest.
Nothing of his is copied into this repository.

**Why we still keep our own implementation:**

1. **Dependency.** `registry/ make check` must run on a stock interpreter with no
   `pip install` — that is the registry's contract with contributors. scipy and
   pandas are not available there. The stdlib fallback exists for that
   environment and agrees with the numpy path to 1.8 % of a CI width.
2. **Licence** (§10).

**Recommendation:** import `kld_eval` as a library where it is installed; do not
fork the CLI; do not vendor the source.

---

## 10. Licence — an operator decision, not a default

His model repo carries `license: other`, `license_name: shapleymcg-1.0`, and a
29,918-byte root `LICENSE`: the **SHAPLEYMCG LICENSE 1.0**, an
"Attribution-Required, Source-Available License with Named Exclusion",
© 2026 Brandon M. Music. §10.5 states it is not OSI-approved and should not be
called open source.

- §1.5(a) names an **Excluded Party** (the person behind the "0xSero" persona,
  `github.com/0xsero` and `huggingface.co/0xSero`); §1.6 makes those Excluded
  Channels; §4.1 grants them no rights; §4.3 says public availability is not
  permission.
- **We are not the Excluded Party** — the opposite: his `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
  credits "malaiwah for the GLM-5.2 MTP-78 overlay and calibration capture", and
  his Schedule A audit clears 99 of 112 repositories and states the excluded
  party's REAP pipeline is independent and predates his corpus.
- **But we publish a fidelity number for an 0xSero artifact**
  (`measurement--glm53.dione-q4.brandonmusic-final25` = 0.027262784815 for
  `artifact--0xsero.glm-5.3-flash-exl3-q4`). Measuring a third party's model is
  not "use of the Work" and is not done for their benefit, so §4.2 does not reach
  it. The live questions are §5.1 ("must not … knowingly permit the Excluded
  Party to obtain it through You") against a public GitHub repository, and §1.2's
  broad Derivative definition, which sweeps in "re-implementations made with
  reference to the Work".
- §3 attribution is a **condition on the grant**, not a covenant (§2.4): use
  outside it is unlicensed. §3.1 requires the full LICENSE text plus the Schedule
  B notice in every copy and Derivative; §3.2 requires prominent attribution in
  any published benchmark, model card, README or post relying on the Work.

**What we did:** clean-room implementation of the statistics (BCa,
cluster-robust SE, McNemar, Wilson, n-gram shingling are all textbook and are
specified in Appendix A of the report he asked us to read); adoption of the
protocol design with loud citation; **no `kld_eval` source vendored into this
repository**. The one thing we do reproduce is a fixture of 25 per-window means
and his published CI endpoints — measurement *results*, cited and attributed, not
code — so that his numbers are the known-answer test our implementation must pass.

**Open question for him, and it costs nothing to ask:** may we depend on
`kld_eval` as a library, and what attribution do you want where? A one-line
answer removes the ambiguity entirely.

## 11. Corrections both sides should make

**Ours:**

1. `uncertainty.method: "none"` on **every one of the 16 rows we published on his
   two panels** (8 on `final25`, 8 on the `final-0000` sub-panel) — **fixed**: 12
   rows now carry BCa intervals and the rest carry the new
   fields where their receipts allow. (Registry-wide the picture was less bad than
   that sentence used to say: 39 of our 60 rows already carried a context-cluster
   bootstrap. His panel was the hole, not the whole registry, and an earlier draft
   of this document overstated it in his favour.)
2. No per-domain publication despite computing it — **fixed** (`by_domain`).
3. No protocol file — **fixed** (`registry/protocol/glm53-joint-kld-protocol.v1.json`).
4. No masking policy recorded — **fixed** (`estimator.vocab_masking_policy`,
   invariant JOINT-007); actual all-row masked deltas remain unmeasured (§3).
5. The excess-over-control residuals (K6 0.002209 / K8 0.000878) are
   **panel25** numbers, their once-published ratio ("2.52×") is withdrawn
   (P1-05), and the clean-scope version needs a re-measured streaming BF16
   floor with per-window output.
6. Our published rows quoted no interval at all. Anyone who inferred one from
   `std/sqrt(N)` was off by 4.6–10× (the design effect, §5.3).

**His, offered in the same spirit:**

1. **Scope labelling.** The clean-17-window means are 0.029258 (EXL3) and
   0.049640 (NVFP4); the full-25 means are 0.030480 and 0.049218. The "51,175
   positions" figure belongs to the panel scope, not the clean one. A summary
   that puts 0.0305 in a row labelled "clean scope" is mixing them.
2. `kld_card.md` says **"25 windows / 34,799 scored positions"** — 34,799 is 17
   windows. Looks like `analysis/cards.py` takes the window count from the
   manifest and the token count from the selected scope.
3. The headline table pairs the **clean-scope** NVFP4 mean/CI with a `sigma_run`
   computed on the **panel** scope, and the quadrature check uses the **panel**
   SE.
4. `sigma_run = 3.33e-4` is n = 2, one degree of freedom (§5.4).
5. The KV/backend paired control ran on the 12-window subset `final-0000…0011`,
   which **includes three contaminated windows** (0003, 0007, 0011). Within-engine
   and paired, so low impact — but it is not a clean-scope result.
6. The EXL3-vs-NVFP4 comparison changes three things at once (weight format,
   attention backend, KV dtype) plus the container image. His
   `paired_kvfp8_vs_kvnvfp4` control bounds two of the three at ±0.006 nats
   against a 0.0204-nats effect — **that is a strong result and it deserves to be
   stated explicitly**; "KV dtype is a non-lever" undersells what the experiment
   actually controlled.
7. **The 0.0246 anchor is labelled three different ways** and this one matters
   most — see §12.
8. `_percentile_ok`'s float boundary (§5.5).
9. `r0_student_canary.json` carries no `protocol_sha256`.
10. The per-token Parquet is gitignored, so **no third party can recompute his
    percentiles, top-1 rates, per-domain CIs, `rms_delta_p`, `ln_ppl_ratio`, or
    any McNemar cell count** — only the means and mean-CIs, via the per-window
    arrays. Publishing per-window sufficient statistics (n, Σd, Σd², top-1 counts,
    a few quantiles) would close that at negligible cost. It is the single
    highest-value thing to ask for.

---

## 12. The 0.0246 anchor must be resolved before either side publishes a lane gap

The lane-gap argument both sides want as a headline rests on one number, and it
is described three different ways:

1. **His `RUN_SUMMARY.md`:** "the community/cloud pipeline (transformers eager,
   EP4, B200) reported ≈0.0246 for this checkpoint" — i.e. *his artifact measured
   by us*.
2. **His `kld_card.md`:** "official FP8 ≈ 0.0206 (other stack) / 0.0246 (this
   stack)" — i.e. *the FP8 release, not his 4bpw*.
3. **Our registry:** `measurement--glm53.brandonmusic-4bpw.brandonmusic-final25`
   = 0.024554564250, on `pipeline--brandonmusic.glm53-packed-kld`, whose record
   reads "brandonmusic packed-surface KLD scorer (k4-tp2)", disclosure
   `author_reported_only`. Source: his own `results/five-cold-run-kld.json`
   (sha256 `d955bfae…`, hash-verified). That file names no engine and no stack.

**We have never measured his 4bpw ourselves.** Our published `reports/` tree
contains no 4bpw report, and both 4bpw rows in our registry sit on *his*
pipelines. So (1) looks like his own `k4-tp2` number attributed to us by mistake,
and (3) is a TP2 packed-surface replay, not "transformers eager, EP4, B200". And
there is a plausible collision behind (2): our registry also holds the official
FP8 on the single-window sub-panel at 0.024629 / 0.024582 / 0.024611 — **two
unrelated quantities that both round to 0.0246 at three significant figures.**
None of this is a gotcha; it is the kind of thing that happens when a number
travels between two people's write-ups, and it travelled in both directions.

The arithmetic he built on it checks out: 0.030480 − 0.024555 = **0.005926 nats**
(ratio 1.2413), and his panel BCa lower bound 0.024965 excludes 0.024555 by
0.000410 — exactly his "narrowly excludes by ~0.0004". **The number is right; the
label on it is wrong in at least two of three places.**
The same caveat cuts both ways and both sides should fix it together: our registry
marks that row `class: advisory` because it is a different reader, and his Discord
post lists our 0.0137 as a same-panel reference point — true of the panel, but our
0.0137 comes off a different stack from his 0.0305, which is exactly the
distinction §8 is about. Neither of us should publish a lane-gap headline until
the labels are agreed.

---

## 13. Open questions for a joint decision

1. **The overlap threshold.** 0.05 is undefended and the correction it produces
   varies by 3× across plausible values (§4.2). Options: keep 0.05 and justify
   it; move to 0.075 where the window count plateaus; or publish a
   threshold-sensitivity band with every scope-dependent number. We lean towards
   the third.
2. **Report both scopes, always?** Our answer is yes — they move different
   contributors' rows in *opposite* directions, so neither can stand in for the
   other. That is now mechanical on our side: `clean17` is a separate panel with
   a separate comparability key.
3. **Protocol hashing: bytes or scoring subset?** We propose both (§6).
4. **Does the padded-column policy belong in a comparability key?** We say no,
   with 1e-10 nats of evidence (§3), and record it as a disclosed estimator
   property instead.
5. **May a same-lane, same-scope floor difference be published as a headline?**
   His §5.3 says no; our §4.5 evidence says the difference is the *stable* half.
   Worth ten minutes.
6. **Per-window sufficient statistics as a publication requirement?** Neither of
   us publishes per-token arrays. Both of us could publish per-window
   (n, Σd, Σd², top-1 count, quantile sketch) cheaply, and that makes every
   statistic in this standard independently recomputable by a third party.
7. **Licence terms for depending on `kld_eval`** (§10).
8. **Minimum cold runs on a non-deterministic path.** His own standard says ≥3;
   his headline NVFP4 sigma is n = 2. We would rather the standard held.
9. **The standard has no field for the axis his own strongest result sits on**
   (§8). His 0.030480 and his 0.024555 differ by the *runtime/kernel path of the
   student* on one checkpoint, one panel, one teacher. Our `stack_relation`
   describes teacher-vs-student within a measurement and does not reach it; our
   `pipeline_ref` names it but is deliberately excluded from the comparability
   key, so two rows differing only in engine path compare as if they were the
   same measurement. Either the key gains an engine-path component or every
   number carries an engine identity beside it. This is the gap we would most
   like to close jointly, and his data is what exposed it.

Emitted analyses are in `docs/joint-standard/analysis/`; the per-window inputs
they read are in `registry/protocol/per-window/`.

**Every section now reproduces from this repository**, §3 included: its script
is `bin/padded_column_study.py` and its receipts are in
`docs/joint-standard/padded-column/`. The only external input anywhere is his
1.27 GB teacher window, and the half of §3 that carries the conclusion — padded
columns hold ~1.6e-8 of the teacher's mass — needs *only* that window, no
`lm_head` and no reconstruction, in about seven seconds.

`bin/check_doc_numbers.py` re-derives every anchored number in **both**
documents from the committed receipts and fails on a mismatch. It exists because
five wrong numbers reached these documents while nothing mechanically tied them
to the data: a scope-direction claim three rows contradicted, a "10× tighter"
that measured 4.2×, a row count that was 16 rather than 13, a padded-column cap
quoted an order tighter than the identity supports, and a student count of ten
that was thirteen. On its first run against the repaired documents it found a
sixth — a per-domain ratio printed as 1.303× where the receipt says 1.302×.
