# NAMING-SWEEP.md — retiring GLM-specific names from a model-agnostic scorer

This repository began as one campaign: measure the fidelity of a K6 encode of
GLM-5.3-Flash. It now includes measurements of GLM-5.3-Flash,
Qwen3.8-27B and Fruit, plus truncated loader/capture experiments for MiniMax-M3,
DeepSeek V4 and Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (not blanket full-model qualification). The GitHub repository was renamed
`glm53-fidelity-suite` → `quant-fidelity-suite`; the code did not follow, and a
name that says "glm53" on a MiniMax run is no longer quaint, it is wrong.

This document is the decision list for that sweep, written **before** the
changes, so every verdict is reviewable line by line. It was landed in six
commits, one concern each, each green on `bash bin/selftest_all.sh` and
`cd registry && make check && make reseed-check`:

This is migration history, not a current compatibility promise or a full
scientific test report. Historical test counts, fallback windows and campaign
paths below describe that sweep. The stage harness exercised control flow with
stubs, not production model forwards; source/identity inventories alone do
not establish reader or native-kernel correctness.

| commit | concern |
|---|---|
| `docs/NAMING-SWEEP.md` | this inventory, before any file moved |
| stage driver harness | `bin/selftest_stage_measure.py` — nine of eleven stages had only ever been grepped |
| published-identity freeze | `bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py` + `bin/published-identity.json`, landed BEFORE the renames so it guarded them |
| `FIDELITY_K6_ROOT` → `FIDELITY_ENGINE_ROOT` | and `/home/jl_fs/glm53-k6` → `/home/jl_fs/fidelity-engine` |
| `k6_kld_report.py` → `kld_report.py` | and `k6_student_capture.py` → `student_capture.py` |
| `k6_driver` / `k6_publish` / `stage_k6.sh` | → `campaign_driver` / `publish_release` / `stage_campaign.sh` |
| `k6/` → `engines/` | 343 files, `git mv` |

## The rule the sweep runs on

There are two kinds of "GLM" and "K6" in this tree, and they get treated
oppositely.

**RENAME** — the name is *incidental*: it records where the code started, not
what it is. Directory names, module filenames, environment variables, local
variables, filesystem roots, and prose that says "GLM" where it means "the
model".

**KEEP** — the name is *identity*: something hashed, sealed, published, or
pointed at by someone else.

* **Registry ids** (`measurement--glm53.*`, `artifact--zai-org.*`,
  `panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25`, `reference--*`, `pipeline--*`,
  `model--*`). `COMPARABILITY_KEY_FIELDS` hashes `panel_id` and
  `reference_id`; renaming one silently regroups every measurement that
  referenced it. **76 of the registry's 159 ids contain "glm". All 76 stay.**
* **Receipt schema strings** (`malaiwah.glm53-*-kld-summary.v1`,
  `quant-pipeline.glm53-token-panel.v1`, `glm53flash-fidelity-capture/2`, …).
  They appear in sealed receipts whose `receipt_sha256` covers their bytes.
  **131 distinct schema literals in the code contain "glm". All 131 stay.**
* **Anything under `registry/receipts/`** (10 sealed receipts),
  **`registry/data/*.jsonl`**, **`reports/stack-provenance-retro.json`**, and
  every `*.receipt.json` / `*-evidence/*.json` under the engine tree.
* **Real model names, HF repo ids, revisions, architecture ids**
  (`zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16`, `glm_moe_dsa`, `glm5_next`,
  `Glm5NextForConditionalGeneration`, `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM`), and upstream
  module names from brandonmusic's pipeline
  (`quant_pipeline.evaluation.glm53_packed_k4_reader`).
* **Profile labels naming a published receipt family** (`turbo-4.05bpw`,
  `k6-stream-tp4`, `--profile k6|k8|k6k8`).

When in doubt the string stays, and the reason is written down. A rename that
breaks a seal is far worse than a name that reads oddly.

## RENAME — the decision list

| # | from | to | scope | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `k6/` (directory) | `engines/` | 343 tracked files moved with `git mv`; ~120 text files referenced the path | The old directory name described the K6 campaign; the new name describes the engine tree. This corrects a mechanical documentation rewrite that made the row read `engines/` → `engines/`. |
| R2 | `FIDELITY_K6_ROOT` | `FIDELITY_ENGINE_ROOT` | 15 occurrences, 8 files | An exported on-instance root. The old name says which campaign paid for the box. **The old spelling is still read as a fallback, and `_stage_env` still exports it alongside the new one for one release** — a controller and an instance can come from different checkouts, and `container/Dockerfile` bakes `FIDELITY_K6_ROOT=/opt/fidelity` today. A root that resolves to nothing is a run written into a container's ephemeral layer, which is defect H3. |
| R3 | `/home/jl_fs/glm53-k6`, `/workspace/glm53-k6` | `/home/jl_fs/fidelity-engine`, `/workspace/fidelity-engine` | 12 literals in `bin/` | A model name baked into a filesystem path on rented hardware. This is the same defect class as the three `/home/jl_fs` roots that each cost a paid run, one provider deep instead of one model deep. Consequence: the first run against a provider filesystem that still holds the old tree re-bootstraps into the new root. The bootstrap is idempotent and guarded, so this costs time, not correctness. |
| R4 | `Teardown.k6_root` | `Teardown.engine_root` | `bin/measure_cloud.py` | Follows R2. `selftest_provider_portability.py` now asserts that neither provider's engine root contains a model or campaign token, so the next one is caught without renting anything. |
| R5 | `engines/tools/k6_kld_report.py` | `engines/tools/kld_report.py` | bundle entry, `engines.json` entrypoint, 2 shell guards, docs | It scores any capture against any teacher. Nothing in it is K6. |
| R6 | `engines/tools/k6_student_capture.py` | `engines/tools/student_capture.py` | bundle entry, `engines.json` | Same. |
| R7 | `engines/tools/k6_driver.py` | `engines/tools/campaign_driver.py` | `stage_campaign.sh`, `engines/RUNBOOK.md` | It drives *an* encode campaign; the profile is a `--profile` flag (`k6`, `k8`, `k6k8`), not part of the tool. |
| R8 | `engines/tools/k6_publish.py` | `engines/tools/publish_release.py` | `stage_campaign.sh`, `engines/RUNBOOK.md` | Same. |
| R9 | `engines/k6_publish.py` | *deleted* | — | **Byte-identical duplicate** of `engines/tools/k6_publish.py` (sha256 match). Nothing invokes the top-level copy: `stage_k6.sh` runs `$TOOLS/k6_publish.py`. This is the drift class `selftest_canonical_json.py` exists for, caught before it drifted. |
| R10 | `engines/stage_k6.sh` | `engines/stage_campaign.sh` | `bin/bootstrap_measure.sh` prose, `bin/stage_measure.sh` prose, `bin/_check_kld_profiles.py`, docs | It is the encode-campaign staging script; the measurement lane has owned its own bootstrap since `bootstrap_measure.sh` landed. |
| R11 | `~/.cache/glm53-fidelity` | `~/.cache/quant-fidelity` | `bin/fidelity/registry_client.py`, `bin/fixture_fetch.py` | `FIDELITY_CACHE_DIR`'s default. Renaming orphans an existing cache; the only thing in it is the 0.1B fixture and registry snapshots, both re-fetchable. |
| R12 | `docs/GLM53-LAYER-OUTER.md` | `docs/LAYER-OUTER.md` | 8 references | The subject is a general schedule. Rename recorded by commit `6b06e309b38ba24cf558f81843c39bf55064d5e7`; this corrects the mechanical rewrite that made both columns identical. |
| R13 | `selftest_progress.py` rung P11's hardcoded `engines/tools/` prefix | derived from `BUNDLE.txt` itself | `bin/selftest_progress.py` | The bundle-completeness rung was itself hardcoded to the campaign directory, so the directory rename would have silently reduced it to checking nothing. Deriving the engine directory from the bundle makes the rung rename-proof. |
| R14 | prose: "`engines/tools/` … assumes GLM-5.3-Flash and the K6 encode" | prose naming the engine tree | `bin/README.md`, `bin/BUNDLE.txt`, `registry/CONTRIBUTING.md` | False as written: those surfaces read MLX, GGUF, NVFP4, EXL3 and stream four architectures. |
| R15 | `/Users/someone/Projects/glm53-fidelity-suite/registry` | `…/quant-fidelity-suite/registry` | `bin/selftest_fidelity_card.py` fixture | A test fixture quoting the pre-rename repository name. |

---

## KEEP — and the reason

| what | count | why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| registry ids containing `glm` in `registry/data/*.jsonl` | 76 | Published identities. `panel_id` and `reference_id` are hashed into `comparability.key`; changing one regroups every measurement that used it. |
| receipt schema literals containing `glm` in `bin/`, `engines/tools/`, `registry/tools/` | 131 | They are inside sealed receipts. `receipt_sha256` covers their bytes and registry invariant `RECEIPT-001` refuses a row whose receipt was edited. |
| `registry/receipts/**` (incl. `stream-k6-kld.json`, `stream-k6-verdict.json`) | 10 files | Sealed and published. The absolute paths inside them (`/home/jl_fs/glm53-k6/...`) record where the run actually happened; that is provenance, not configuration. |
| `registry/data/*.jsonl` prose citing `engines/tools/dione_surface.py`, `engines/tools/hf_capture.py`, `engines/tools/k6_kld_report.py`, `engines/tools/derive_scope.py`, `engines/K8-ANOMALY.json` | 14 rows | These name the code **at the commit that produced the number**. Rewriting them would change `scope_digest` and would break `make reseed-check` against `seed_registry.py`. Historical paths in a provenance field are correct even after the tree moves. |
| `registry/tools/seed_registry.py` strings that generate the rows above | — | Same reason: it is the generator of `registry/data`. |
| `reports/stack-provenance-retro.json` | 1 | Sealed receipt; it already pins its claims to commit `6a04873`, where those paths existed. |
| `docs/examples/fidelity-dataset.{root-glm53-bf16,quant-glm53-k6}.json`, `docs/examples/fidelity-comparison-receipt.k6-vs-bf16.json` | 3 | Sealed (`receipt_sha256`) and re-verified by `bin/selftest_fidelity_dataset.py`. They are the published *examples* of our GLM-5.3 root and K6 quant captures — the names describe the data. |
| `docs/joint-standard/analysis/k6-*.json`, `paired.K6-vs-*.json`, `registry/protocol/per-window/k6-*.json` | 12 | Analysis outputs for the K6 artifact. The name is the subject. |
| `registry/protocol/glm53-joint-kld-protocol.v1.json` | 1 | The filename mirrors its own `schema` id `malaiwah.glm53-joint-kld-protocol.v1`, which is sealed. Renaming the file and not the schema (or vice versa) is exactly the two-sided-agreement bug this sweep is supposed to avoid. |
| `engines/recipes/{k6,k8,k6k8}.json`, `--profile k6|k8|k6k8`, `QP_STREAM_PROFILE` values | — | They name real encode profiles that published rows were measured at. |
| `engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`, `engines/K8-ANOMALY.md`, `engines/DECISIONS.md`, `engines/RUNBOOK.md` | — | Their subject *is* the K6/K8 campaign. Only their directory moves. |
| `engines/tools/glm53-stagea-evidence/`, `engines/tools/exl3hf-evidence/scope-turbo-*.json`, `engines/tools/mlx-evidence/real-dequant-fixtures/GLM-5_3-Flash-*.npz` | — | Evidence describing actual GLM-5.3-Flash artifacts. |
| `engines/patches*/`, `engines/.patchwork/` | 20 patches + 2 trees | Verbatim patch series against brandonmusic's pipeline, applied on the instance by `bootstrap_measure.sh` and hashed in `hidden-replay-evidence/patches-applied.txt`. Their filenames are content. |
| `remote/` (`/home/ubuntu/glm53`, `/glm53` container mount, `vllm/vllm-openai:glm53-flash-*`) | 10 files | The historical GLM-5.3 vLLM serving-lane campaign. Those paths are on a machine that produced published receipts, and the published model cards ship `MODEL_PROFILE=glm53-k6` as a deployment instruction. |
| `bin/fidelity/stackprint.py` `IMAGE_PIN_CONVENTION_PATH = "/glm53/out/image-pin.txt"` | 1 | It must equal the path `remote/vm_setup.sh` actually writes. Changing one side silently loses the container digest. A new test now asserts the two agree (see below). |
| `port/glm5_next.py.draft`, `port/tests/glm5_layer_parity.py` | 2 | `glm5_next` is the architecture's real `model_type`. |
| `docs/GLM53-ROOT-FEASIBILITY.md` | 1 | Its subject is literally "Can we capture a root fidelity dataset for GLM-5.3". |
| `docs/cards/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-*.README.md` | 2 | Published HF model cards for real GLM-5.3-Flash artifacts. |
| `JOURNAL.md` | 1 | A dated log of what happened. Paths in it are correct as of the entry that mentions them; rewriting them would be rewriting history. |

## Known consequence of R1 that cannot be fixed from this repository

Two **already-published** HF model cards deep-link into the old directory:

* `docs/cards/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-6bpw.README.md` → `.../blob/main/engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`,
  `.../blob/main/engines/fallback/closure-comparison.json`
* `docs/cards/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-8bpw.README.md` → `.../blob/main/engines/K8-ANOMALY.md`,
  `.../blob/main/engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`, `.../blob/main/engines/fallback/closure-comparison.json`

GitHub does not redirect file paths across a directory rename, so the copies
**on Hugging Face** will 404 until the cards are re-pushed. The sources in
`docs/cards/` are updated by this sweep, so a re-push fixes them; publishing is
outside this change's remit and is left as an explicit follow-up.

`llms.txt` links (`engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`, `engines/K8-ANOMALY.md`, `engines/HANDOFF.md`) are
served from this repository's `main` and are corrected here, so they heal on
merge.

## Tests added or strengthened by this sweep

Each was verified to FAIL without its fix, by reintroducing the defect in a
scratch copy; the commit that adds it says which failure it produced.

1. **`bin/selftest_stage_measure.py` (T16) — the stage driver, EXECUTED.**
   Before it, two of `bin/stage_measure.sh`'s eleven stages were ever run by a
   test; the other nine were "covered" by grepping the file for a substring.
   This drives every stage under a real bash with argv-logging stubs, running
   `invoke_engine.py`, `invoke_scorer.py` and `seal_receipt.py` for real where
   the thing under test is their argv composition. Four properties per stage:
   roots come from the environment, a missing input fails CLOSED, the `.done`
   marker appears only on success, and no argument names a path the environment
   did not supply. **Acceptance test:** all four historical stage bugs were
   reintroduced and it names each — `QP_PIPELINE_ROOT` hardcoded in `measure`
   (an A100 at 0% GPU for two hours), the same defect in `score`, the roots
   never exported (45 failures across every stage), and `jqget` printing a JSON
   null as `"None"` (reproducing the exact `--preview-of None` argv and the
   `panel not uploaded: .../fs/None` message).

2. **`bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py` N1 — published identity is frozen.**
   `bin/published-identity.json` holds every registry id (159), every sealed
   receipt schema string (9), every schema literal the code emits (242) and
   every provenance path a published row names (23). `harness_id` is a sha256
   over `{boundary, [{role, PATH, sha256}], tool_versions}`, so those paths are
   inside the hash. The test fails if one *disappears*; adding is always
   allowed, because a new measurement adds ids. This is the regression test for
   the very operation this document describes, and it landed **before** the
   renames rather than after, so it guarded them.

3. **`bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py` N2 — no model name in an instance root.**
   Extends the `/home/jl_fs` rule in `selftest_provider_portability.py` from
   *provider* names to *model* names: no path rooted where a provider mounts
   storage (`/home`, `/workspace`, `/mnt`, `/data`, `/root`, `/opt`, `/srv`) in
   an uploaded on-instance tool may contain `glm`, `k6`, `k8`, `qwen`,
   `minimax`, `deepseek`, `fruit`, `tr3`, `exl3`, `gguf`, `mlx` or `nvfp4`. Two
   further rungs assert the rule actually read files and actually found paths
   to judge, because a check that silently stops looking is worse than none.
   `selftest_provider_portability.py` gained the same rule for the root the
   controller *chooses*, on both providers.

4. **`bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py` N3 — two-file agreements.** Every
   `FIDELITY_*_ROOT` that `measure_cloud._stage_env()` exports must be read by
   an on-instance script; `stackprint.IMAGE_PIN_CONVENTION_PATH` must be the
   path `remote/vm_setup.sh` actually writes; every non-local `engines.json`
   entrypoint must exist AND be in `BUNDLE.txt` — with `bin/kld_preview.py`'s
   deliberate absence asserted, so nobody "fixes" it; every `BUNDLE.txt` entry
   must exist.

5. **`bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py` N4 — no byte-identical duplicated script.**
   `k6/k6_publish.py` was a sha256-identical copy of `k6/tools/k6_publish.py`
   and only the second was ever invoked. Deleted. `.patchwork/a` vs
   `.patchwork/b` are exempt: two pinned snapshots kept side by side on purpose.

6. **`bin/selftest_progress.py` P11 / P11b** now derive the engine directories
   from `BUNDLE.txt` instead of hardcoding `k6/tools`, and follow imports for
   every bundled Python file rather than only the engines. Hardcoded, the
   `k6/` → `engines/` rename would have left the rung scanning a directory that
   no longer exists — PASSING vacuously, while the defect it guards (an
   ImportError at the start of the measure stage, after the bootstrap, the
   200 GB fetch and the panel are all paid for) stays invisible locally. P11b
   asserts it read 46 modules across four directories.

## What the sweep itself found

* **`registry/tools/seed_registry.py` reads a path off disk.**
  `scope_from_evidence("engines/tools/exl3hf-evidence/scope-turbo-2.05bpw.json")`
  derives an artifact's published scope from that file. Skipping the whole file
  as "published strings" left the read path dangling, and `make reseed-check`
  caught it. Read paths follow the tree; published fields do not, and the file
  now carries a comment saying which is which.
* **`bin/stage_measure.sh`'s header had been false for weeks.** It claimed the
  bootstrap lived in `k6/stage_k6.sh` and that this script "arranges the layout
  stage_k6.sh expects and calls it". Both stopped being true when
  `bin/bootstrap_measure.sh` landed — the code 80 lines below already called
  `bootstrap_measure.sh`, and that file's own header explains why the
  delegation could never work. Corrected rather than renamed.
* **`k6/k6_publish.py` and `k6/tools/k6_publish.py` were byte-identical**, and
  only the `tools/` copy was ever invoked.
* **`bin/kld_preview.py` is an `engines.json` entrypoint that is deliberately
  not bundled** — it is the *local* lanes' scorer and never runs on rented
  hardware. That was undocumented, so a bundle-completeness check would have
  looked like it had found a bug. It is now asserted as intentional.
