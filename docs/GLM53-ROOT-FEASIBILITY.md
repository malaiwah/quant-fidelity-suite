# Can we capture a root fidelity dataset for GLM-5.3 (the full model)?

**Verdict: GO-WITH-STAGING, and the gate that matters is not a GPU gate.**

**Current status, 2026-09-07:** the full GLM-5.3 root and candidate route
subsequently landed; see [`THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md`](THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md)
and the registry's current reference records. This document preserves the
pre-implementation plan and dated Stage A findings. Statements that no engine
exists, streaming is absent from the checkout, and the old prices/balance or
future stage commands are **archival**, not present operational advice.
Stage A's 836-tensor audit covered a truncation, not every full-model tensor.
Later captures do not retrospectively widen that audit.

`zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16` is our architecture — `glm_moe_dsa`, the same family as
Fruit, which `engines/tools/hf_capture.py` captured end to end. Every config key
Fruit needed is present. The memory arithmetic fits one H200 with room to
spare. The checkpoint fits a JarvisLabs disk. None of that is the problem.

The problem is that **no engine we have can read this checkpoint.** The
portable engine (`hf_capture.py`) materialises the whole model and then calls
`.to(device)`; at 1,486.8 GB that fails on every machine JarvisLabs rents. The
engine that *can* stream a 600 GB BF16 tree on one H200 (`stream_score.py`, via
`engines/tools/hidden_replay.py`) is hard-coded to GLM-5.3-Flash's `glm5_next`
geometry — `HIDDEN_WIDTH = 4096` — and is not in this repository at all.

So the honest shape of the answer is: **the science is ready, the yardstick is
ready, the money is nearly enough, and the capture engine does not exist yet.**
Below is the arithmetic, the three stages, and the one thing most likely to
kill it.

Everything here is metadata fetches, config reads, code reading and local
dry-runs. No GPU was rented and no shard was downloaded.

## 1. What the model actually is

Fetched at revision `304b8051cfb2b260b61ce0cbe330e02a98e73639` (public,
ungated, `license: other`, 291 files, no remote code).

| | `zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16` | `zai-org/GLM-5.3` |
|---|---|---|
| precision | BF16, **no `quantization_config`** | FP8 `e4m3`, block `[128,128]`, dynamic |
| shards | 282 | 141 |
| size | 1,506.7 GB | 755.7 GB |

**The two configs are byte-for-byte identical except that the FP8 one adds
`quantization_config`.** Same 78 layers, same `hidden_size` 6144, same vocab
154,880, same expert layout. That is as clean a root/candidate pair as this
campaign has ever had: the suffix-less repo is a quantisation *of* the `-BF16`
repo, by the publisher's own metadata, exactly as with Flash.

### Config keys, GLM-5.3 vs Fruit

`GLM-5.3-BF16` and `malaiwah/GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit-bf16` have **identical key
sets** except that Fruit carries a legacy top-level `rope_theta` alongside
`rope_parameters`. Nothing GLM-5.3 declares is new to us. The differences are
all scale:

| key | GLM-5.3 | Fruit |
|---|---|---|
| `num_hidden_layers` | 78 | 13 |
| `hidden_size` | 6144 | 1024 |
| `intermediate_size` | 12288 | 2048 |
| `moe_intermediate_size` | 2048 | 512 |
| `num_attention_heads` / `num_key_value_heads` | 64 / 64 | 16 / 16 |
| `q_lora_rank` | 2048 | 1024 |
| `max_position_embeddings` | 1,048,576 | 65,536 |
| `rope_parameters.rope_theta` | 8,000,000 | 500,000 |
| `n_routed_experts` / `num_experts_per_tok` | 256 / 8 | 256 / 8 |
| `first_k_dense_replace` | 3 | 3 |
| `num_nextn_predict_layers` | 1 | 1 |
| `tie_word_embeddings` | **false** | false |
| `kv_lora_rank` / `qk_head_dim` / `v_head_dim` | 512 / 256 / 256 | same |
| `index_head_dim` / `index_n_heads` / `index_topk` / `index_topk_freq` | 128 / 32 / 2048 / 4 | same |

**The one structural difference that matters: the DSA indexer schedule.**
Fruit's `indexer_types` is `full` only for layers 0–2 and `shared` for
everything after. GLM-5.3's is `full` every fourth layer — `[0, 1, 2, 6, 10,
14, …, 74]`, 21 layers — with the rest `shared`.

I verified against the safetensors index that indexer tensors exist on exactly
those 21 layers **plus layer 78**, the MTP layer (`index_share_for_mtp_iteration:
true`). No layer that declares `full` is missing its indexer, and no layer that
declares `shared` carries one.

`index_topk` is 2048 and the modeling code takes `min(index_topk, key_len)`, so
at a 2048-token window the indexer degenerates to full attention. No sparse
kernel is required: the eager/SDPA path turns the top-k into an additive mask,
and `flash-mla` is optional. `_supports_flash_attn` is `False`,
`_supports_sdpa` is `True`.

---

## 2. The arithmetic of scale

Computed from the safetensors index (59,585 tensors) plus tensor shapes
range-fetched from six shard headers. **The census reconciles to the published
`total_size` with a delta of zero bytes**, which is why the rest of this
document is arithmetic rather than estimate.

### Where the 1,506.7 GB is

| component | params | bytes | GiB | share |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| routed experts (76 sparse layers) | 734,439,407,616 | 1,468,878,815,232 | 1368.00 | 97.5% |
| attention (MLA, 79 layers) | 13,036,754,432 | 26,073,508,864 | 24.28 | 1.7% |
| shared expert + router gate | 2,988,461,056 | 5,976,961,024 | 5.57 | 0.4% |
| embed + lm_head + final norm | 1,903,171,584 | 3,806,343,168 | 3.54 | 0.25% |
| dense MLP (layers 0–2) | 679,477,248 | 1,358,954,496 | 1.27 | 0.09% |
| DSA indexer (22 layers) | 206,181,888 | 412,363,776 | 0.38 | 0.03% |
| MTP extras (`eh_proj`, norms) | 75,515,904 | 151,031,808 | 0.14 | 0.01% |
| layernorms | 970,752 | 1,941,504 | 0.00 | — |
| **total** | **753,329,940,480** | **1,506,659,919,872** | **1403.19** | |
| published `metadata.total_size` | | 1,506,659,919,872 | | **delta 0** |

**Per-layer routed-expert bytes: 256 × 3 × 6144 × 2048 × 2 = 19,327,352,832 B
= 18.00 GiB = 19.33 GB.** Verified equal to the observed sum for layer 6.
75 sparse layers in the body, plus the MTP layer 78 = 76.

**Non-routed total: 37,781,104,640 B = 35.19 GiB = 37.78 GB.** (Flash's is
19.34 GB — GLM-5.3's is 1.95×.)

Per-layer totals: dense layer 0.747 GiB; sparse layer 18.381 GiB; sparse layer
with a full indexer 18.398 GiB; MTP layer 78 18.539 GiB.

### What `transformers` actually builds

A meta-device instantiation of `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` from this exact config
(transformers 5.16.1, torch 2.13.0, run locally, no weights, no GPU) builds
**743,377,000,704 parameters = 1,486.8 GB**, not 753.3 B. The difference is
**layer 78: the model does not build the MTP layer at all**, and its 791
tensors land in `unexpected_keys`. Its 18.5 GiB never has to be resident. It
still has to be *fetched*, because only 3 of the 282 shards (16.1 GB) contain
layer-78 tensors exclusively — skipping them saves 1% and complicates the
checkpoint identity, so don't.

### Peak resident memory for a layer-outer streaming forward

Using the census figures directly (`nonrouted` + N layer buffers + panel state
+ the fp32 logit buffer at vocab 154,880 + 1.5 GB framework/attention floor):

| schedule | 8 win | 16 win | 25 win | H200 141 | RTX PRO 6000 96 | H100 80 | M4 Max ~110 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| non-routed resident + **2** layer buffers | 80.0 | 80.8 | **81.7** | fits | fits | **no** | fits |
| non-routed resident + **1** layer buffer | 60.7 | 61.5 | **62.4** | fits | fits | fits | fits |
| non-routed also streamed + 2 buffers | 45.1 | 45.9 | **46.8** | fits | fits | fits | fits |

(GB. Panel state = `windows × 2047 × 6144 × (2+2+4)` bytes; logit buffer =
`2047 × 154880 × 4` = 1.27 GB.)

**One H200 (141 GB) fits the roomiest schedule with 59 GB of headroom.** This
is consistent with the lane's own history: `engines/STREAMING.md` records a measured
34.40–47.08 GB peak for the Flash streaming lane on one H200, and GLM-5.3's
non-routed is 1.95× Flash's while its per-layer routed set is 1.33× Flash's
14.50 GB.

**No multi-GPU is needed and no CPU offload is needed — for a streaming
schedule.** For a whole-model-resident schedule the picture inverts completely;
see §5.

### `bin/fidelity/census.py`'s fit estimator — yes, it points at this model

`Census.from_config` is architecture-generic and reads every key GLM-5.3
declares (`num_hidden_layers`, `first_k_dense_replace`, `n_routed_experts`,
`hidden_size`, `moe_intermediate_size`, `vocab_size`, `num_nextn_predict_layers`;
`hc_mult` defaults to 1, which is correct here — that knob is Flash's). Run
against the real config + the real `total_size` it reports `census_source:
"hf-blobs"` and reproduces the exact figures above:

```
routed_main 1449.55 GB   routed_mtp 19.33 GB   nonrouted 37.78 GB   per_routed_layer 19.33 GB
solve_local(H200, bits=16, ctx=2047, windows=25) -> peak 85.5 GB, expert_chunk 256, passes 1
minimum_viable_budget(bits=16, ctx=2047)          -> 5.25 GB
```

**Caveat on that 85.5 GB: `local_peak_bytes` models the *packed* lane** — it
counts a decoded chunk *and* a packed chunk. At `bits=16` those are the same
bytes counted twice (38.66 GB each). The honest BF16-root figure is the 81.7 GB
in the table above. The estimator is usable for this model; its answer is
conservative by roughly one layer buffer, which is the safe direction.

---

## 3. Disk and fetch

**JarvisLabs caps an instance disk at 2,048 GB** and a shared filesystem at
50–2,048 GB (IN1/IN2 only). Live from `jl gpus --json` / `jl resources --json`.

| item | GB |
|---|---:|
| full checkpoint | 1,506.7 |
| toolchain / venv / HF cache slack (the planner's own constant) | ~40 |
| capture outputs, 25 windows, hidden form | 0.63 |
| **total** | **~1,548** |
| **headroom to the 2,048 GB cap** | **~500** |

It fits, with real margin. `snapshot_download` uses blobs + symlinks, so there
is no duplication — but an interrupted resume leaves `.incomplete` files, and
the campaign has already lost 36 idle minutes (~$2.40) to "Disk quota exceeded"
once (JOURNAL lesson 31). Budget 1,700 GB, not 1,600.

### Fetch time

Measured throughputs in this tree: **430 MB/s** (M1, 165 GB in 6m22s),
**510 MB/s** (M2, 175 GB in 5m42s), **~600 MB/s** (the L4 prep VM, 599 GiB BF16
in 17 min). Against 1,506.7 GB:

| rate | wall clock |
|---|---|
| 430 MB/s | 0.97 h |
| 510 MB/s | 0.82 h |
| 600 MB/s | 0.70 h |

Roughly **one hour**, and it should be done on the cheapest box that can hold
it (1× L4 spot, $0.29/h) writing to a shared filesystem, not on the GPU that
will do the capture. At $0.29/h + 1,700 GB of storage that fetch costs
**$0.40–0.56**.

### Sparse fetch: does not apply

`engines/tools/fetch_nonrouted_sparse.py` exists and works, but it is the wrong tool
here and would be actively misleading. It materialises **only the non-routed**
byte ranges, because the Flash streaming lane reads routed experts from a
*quantized artifact* and non-routed from BF16. A **root** capture is the BF16
model itself — it needs every routed expert.

And it needs all of them, not most: at 2,047 positions and top-8 of 256, the
probability an expert is never selected in a layer is
`(1 − 8/256)^2047 ≈ e^−64 ≈ 0`. **Every expert in every layer is touched by
every window.** There is no sparse subset. Fetch all 1,506.7 GB.

(A second consequence: `hf_capture.py`'s `checkpoint_identity` hashes every
`*.safetensors` in the directory. A partial tree yields a different identity,
which is another reason to fetch whole.)

---

## 4. Capture cost and time

### The measured anchor — and it is not the one we were reaching for

The per-window figures the campaign quotes (2.37–3.19 min/window) are all
**quantized** surfaces, where the cost is trellis *decode*. The right anchor
for a BF16 root is the **BF16 floor lane**, recorded in `bin/engines.json`:

> `minutes_per_window: 8.3` — "MEASURED on 1× H200 spot (IN2, 28 vCPU, 300 GiB
> cgroup) reading the 599 GB BF16 tree off a CephFS filesystem at ~1.05 GB/s
> with 28 reader threads: window 1 (cold, all 42 layers filled) 678 s;
> steady-state windows 483–549 s with `--decode-cache ram` holding 17 of 42
> layers."

Cross-checked: cold run 1 was 12,514.5 s for 25 windows (8.34 min/window) and
read **9.31 TB** — 372 GB per window, i.e. the 25 of 42 layers that did not fit
the RAM cache, at ~744 MB/s effective. The lane **re-reads the routed set once
per window.** That is the entire cost.

### Scaling that to GLM-5.3, honestly

The dense parts scale as `layers × hidden²` and are irrelevant: total compute
for a 25-window panel is **4.11 PFLOP** at ~40.2 B active parameters per token,
which is 20–51 s of H200 time. **Compute is not the bottleneck and never will
be.** The bottleneck is bytes moved, and those scale with `layers ×
n_routed_experts × moe_intermediate × hidden`:

- GLM-5.3 routed set per window: **75 × 19.327 = 1,450 GB** (2.38× Flash's 609)
- with the same 300 GiB RAM cache it holds **16 of 75** layers (vs 17 of 42),
  so **1,140 GB is re-read per window** — **3.07×** Flash's 372 GB

| effective read rate | min/window | 25-window run |
|---|---:|---:|
| 0.74 GB/s (Flash's measured effective) | 25.5 | 10.64 h |
| 1.05 GB/s (CephFS low) | 18.1 | 7.54 h |
| 1.44 GB/s (CephFS high) | 13.2 | 5.50 h |
| 3.0 GB/s (fast local NVMe) | 6.3 | 2.64 h |

**Range, not a point: 13–26 min/window, 5.5–10.6 h per cold run, on the
per-window-re-read design.** Two cold runs is 11–21 h.

### The 20× that is sitting on the table

A **layer-outer, window-inner** schedule — load layer *i*, run every window
through it, free it, go to layer *i+1* — reads the checkpoint **once per run**
instead of once per window:

| effective read rate | per RUN, any window count |
|---|---:|
| 1.05 GB/s | 23.6 min |
| 1.44 GB/s | 17.2 min |
| 3.0 GB/s | 8.3 min |

Plus 1–2 minutes of compute. **This is bitwise identical to the per-window
forward** — windows do not interact, and running each window separately through
a resident layer performs exactly the same sequence of operations on exactly
the same GEMM shapes as a whole-model forward does; only the loop order across
independent windows changes. (This is the same invariance `solve_local`'s
docstring already asserts for `window_batch`, and it holds here for the
stronger reason that no reduction is shared across windows at all.)

`bin/engines.json:408` already knows this and withdrew an old projection for
it: *"the earlier 0.25 min/window figure was a projection of a layer-outer
schedule NO engine implements and is withdrawn."* That sentence is the whole
feasibility question in one line.

### Capture size: hidden form vs logit form

| windows | scored positions | hidden (bf16, ×6144) | logit (fp32, ×154,880) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2 | 4,094 | 50 MB | 2.5 GB |
| 8 | 16,376 | 201 MB | 10.1 GB |
| 16 | 32,752 | 402 MB | 20.3 GB |
| **25** | **51,175** | **629 MB** | **31.7 GB** |

**Hidden form is 50× smaller, at every size.** `hf_capture.py` captures hidden
form only, which is the right default and makes the output storage a rounding
error against 1.5 TB of weights. Logit form would add 31.7 GB per cold run per
model — the exact figure that busted the filesystem in JOURNAL lesson 31.

---

## 5. The panel

**Do not reuse Brandon's sealed 25-window panel.** The token ids are more than
numerically valid: I fetched `zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16`'s `tokenizer.json` and it is
**byte-identical** to the one this repo already holds for GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16 @
`b1967181` and to Fruit's — all three sha256
`19e773648cb4e65de8660ea6365e10acca112d42a854923df93db4a6f333a82d`, 20,217,442
bytes, vocab 154,880. Tokenization is not the objection.

The objection is selection. That panel was built against GLM-5.3-**Flash**'s
corpus and its calibration separation. A number measured on it invites being
ranked against Flash numbers it has no business being ranked against, which is
the cross-model comparison our own rules forbid — and an identical tokenizer
makes that mistake *easier*, not harder, because nothing downstream would
complain. `build_token_panel.py`'s docstring says this better than I can, and it
was written for exactly this situation.

### Recommendation: 25 windows, 5 strata × 5, its own `panel_id`

Build with `engines/tools/build_token_panel.py` — deterministic, no RNG, sorted
traversal and a fixed slice — over the same public corpus Fruit's panel used:

```
corpus     malaiwah/qwen38-27b-fidelity-suite-v5 @ 7797fcce, corpus/text/
strata     code (241 docs), encyclopedic (323), literary (59),
           multilingual (276), scientific (42)      -- verified present
rule       --context-length 2048 --skip-tokens 2048 --windows-per-stratum 5
           => 25 windows x 2047 scored positions = 51,175 scored positions
```

Five strata rather than Fruit's two, because Fruit's own disclosure records
that its two strata differed by nearly 2× on their own (literary 0.0275,
scientific 0.0500) — a two-stratum panel is as much a measure of the mix as of
the model. `scientific` has 42 documents, so 5 per stratum is comfortably
inside eligibility (`≥ skip + context_length = 4096` tokens).

### Historical resolution projection — not calibrated inference

The following table extrapolated Fruit's per-window sd (0.0283 around a mean
of 0.0387) as though GLM-5.3 windows were independent samples from the same
population. Neither that assumption nor GLM-5.3 paired-effect resolution was
established. The panel uses deterministic document traversal and fixed slices,
not probability sampling of deployment text. Treat these figures as historical
planning arithmetic, not confidence intervals or actual separability limits:

| windows | positions | SE | as % of mean | cannot separate closer than |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 16,376 | 0.0100 | 25.9% | ~42% |
| 16 | 32,752 | 0.0071 | 18.3% | ~30% (the published figure) |
| **25** | **51,175** | **0.0057** | **14.6%** | **~24%** |
| 36 | 73,692 | 0.0047 | 12.2% | ~20% |
| 64 | 131,008 | 0.0035 | 9.1% | ~15% |
| 144 | 294,768 | 0.0024 | 6.1% | ~10% |

The `1/√n` scaling requires independent sampling and stable variance; merely
adding correlated windows does not buy it. Matching 51,175 scored positions
does not match another panel's statistical information. The finite-panel mean
is descriptive and exact conditional on the captured bytes/replay arithmetic.
Any source-document uncertainty needs provenance and an explicit sampling
model; absent that provenance, inference is unknown, not window-based.
Layer-outer amortizes checkpoint loading over windows, but the ~35-second
compute increment was a projection, not a universal marginal cost.

Two things this panel will *not* do, and both must be disclosed on the row:

- **It does not establish a population-level FP8 resolution threshold.**
  The old "~24%" separability claim came from the Fruit extrapolation above,
  not GLM-5.3 paired independent-document evidence. At context 2,048, GLM DSA's
  top-k is effectively full attention; this panel does not probe long-context
  sparse-attention behavior.
- **It carries no contamination scan.** `build_token_panel.py` records the
  caller's `--separation-note` verbatim and runs no shingle scan. Against a
  frontier model whose pretraining corpus is undisclosed, "held out" is not
  claimable. Say `separation asserted at source level only`, as the Fruit panel
  does.

## 6. The staged plan

Three stages, a go/no-go gate between each. Rates are live from `jl gpus
--json`: H200 141 GB spot IN2 **$1.99**/GPU-h (on-demand $3.99), RTX PRO 6000
96 GB spot IN1 **$0.99**, L4 spot **$0.29**, storage **$0.00017**/GB-h (the
repo's own inferred planner constant, ±100%; the vendor page implies $0.00014).
**No B200 is offered on this platform** — the newest silicon is Blackwell RTX
PRO 6000 at 96 GB. Max 8 GPUs per instance.

**Account balance: $90.318.** That number is a hard constraint on stage C and
it is why the staging matters.

### Stage A — the free smoke. Cost: $0.00. Do this first, today.

Two parts, both already possible without renting anything.

**A1 — already done, in this document.** A meta-device instantiation of
`GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` from the real config, diffed against the real
safetensors index. Results are in §1 and §2 and they answer three of the
questions this stage was meant to answer: the model builds, the indexer
schedule is coherent, layer 78 is not built, `tie_word_embeddings` is false and
the head carries **no bias** (so `hf_capture`'s HEAD gate passes).

**A2 — a truncated real-weights capture on the operator's own M4 Max.**
*(DONE 2026-08-30. Results, and two corrections to the recipe below, in
section 9.)* The
local box has **137 GB unified memory and 1.3 TiB free disk**. Fetch only the
**9 shards (43.2 GB)** that carry `embed_tokens`, `lm_head`, `model.norm` and
layers 0–3, write a pruned index, set `num_hidden_layers: 4`, and run
`bin/fidelity-dataset capture --engine hf-transformers --device cpu` (or `mps`)
on a 2-window panel.

That proves, for **zero dollars**, every mechanism that stage B would otherwise
discover on a metered box:

1. the `WeightConverter` fires and `missing_keys` is empty (see the gate below);
2. layers 0–2 build their own indexer and layer 3 correctly consumes layer 2's
   `prev_topk_indices` through the `shared` path;
3. the `lm_head` forward pre-hook fires exactly once and yields
   `[1, seq, 6144]` in bf16;
4. `build_token_panel.py` produces a panel `hf_capture` accepts, and the
   three-step `capture | verify | compare --self-compare | publish` chain runs
   end to end on `glm_moe_dsa` at hidden width 6144.

**Additionally, and this is the highest-value check in the whole plan:** read
`model.model.layers[3].mlp.experts.gate_up_proj[k]` back out and compare it
byte-for-byte against the raw shard bytes for
`model.layers.3.mlp.experts.{k}.{gate,up}_proj.weight`, for several `k`
including 0 and 255. That proves the 256→1 expert merge is correct **and in the
right order** (`MergeModulelist(dim=0)` then `Concatenate(dim=1)`, gate rows
first, matching `modeling_glm_moe_dsa.py:571`'s `chunk(2, dim=-1)`).

> **Gate A → B.** Stop if `missing_keys`, `mismatched_keys` or `error_msgs` is
> non-empty; if the fused expert bytes do not match the shard bytes exactly; if
> the head hook fires more than once; or if the hidden dtype is not bf16.

### Stage B — a small-panel root capture at scale. Cost: see the table.

Prove the path on real hardware at the real size, with an 8-window panel and
**two cold runs in two separate processes**, verified by
`fidelity-dataset compare --self-compare` (the spec's SC-1). Two runs, because
one is not evidence of determinism — the campaign's own convention.

The cost depends entirely on which engine exists by then:

| lane | $/h | hours | **cost** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **B-3** 1× H200 + a layer-outer engine, fast IO | 2.28 | 1.07 | **$2.45** |
| **B-3** 1× H200 + a layer-outer engine, slow IO | 2.28 | 1.29 | **$2.93** |
| **B-2** 1× H200 + accelerate disk-offload, fast IO | 2.51 | 5.49 | **$13.77** |
| **B-2** 1× H200 + accelerate disk-offload, slow IO | 2.51 | 7.19 | **$18.04** |
| **B-1** 8× H200 + `device_map="auto"` | 16.21 | 3.19 | **$51.76** |

Add **$0.40–0.56** of one-time fetch to every row. Assumptions:

- **B-1** places ~1,050 GiB of 1,385 GiB on eight H200s and spills ~334 GiB to
  CPU RAM (8 × 300 GB = 2,400 GB, so it fits). Per-window that is a 358 GB
  pageable H2D transfer; this repo measured pageable H2D at **1.23 GB/s**
  (`engines/STREAMING.md`: "a 14.50 GB pageable H2D copy (~11.8 s)"), giving **4.9
  min/window**. Every cold run needs a fresh process, hence a full 0.75 h
  reload. This lane needs only a small `hf_capture` patch — pass `device_map` /
  `max_memory` and skip the `model.to(device)` that follows `from_pretrained`,
  because `.to()` on a dispatched model raises.
- **B-2** uses accelerate's disk offload, which **writes a second full copy** of
  the weights as `.dat` files: 1,506.7 GB of source + 1,486.8 GB of offload =
  **~3.0 TB**, which exceeds the 2,048 GB instance-disk cap and therefore needs
  a 2,048 GB instance disk *and* a 2,048 GB shared filesystem. That is the
  hidden cost of this lane, and it is why its storage line is $0.52/h.
- **B-3** is the only lane that reads 1,486.8 GB once per run instead of once
  per window, and the only one whose cost does not move when the panel grows.

> **Gate B → C.** Stop if the two cold runs are not bitwise identical; if peak
> memory exceeds the §2 table by more than the 1.35× headroom factor
> `census.py` already applies; if wall clock per window exceeds 1.5× the range
> in §4 (the IO estimate was wrong and stage C's price is wrong with it); or if
> the instance is preempted more than once, which prices stage C out on its own.

### Stage C — the full root capture and publish

25 windows, two cold runs, then `verify`, `compare --self-compare`, seal, and
the registry path.

| lane | $/h | hours | **cost** | fits $90.32 balance? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|:--:|
| **C-3** 1× H200 + layer-outer engine | 2.28 | 1.1–1.3 | **$2.45–2.93** | yes, 30× over |
| **C-2** 1× H200 + accelerate disk-offload, fast IO | 2.51 | 15.24 | **$38.23** | yes |
| **C-2** 1× H200 + accelerate disk-offload, slow IO | 2.51 | 20.57 | **$51.59** | yes, thin |
| **C-1** 8× H200 + `device_map="auto"` | 16.21 | 5.94 | **$96.32** | **NO** |

Plus fetch, plus whatever stage B consumed.

**This is the decision.** Stage C on the existing-tooling multi-GPU lane costs
more than the account holds. Stage C on the disk-offload lane costs $38–52 and
leaves the balance too thin for a retry after a spot preemption on a
15–21-hour run — and a 15–21-hour spot run *will* be preempted. Stage C on a
layer-outer engine costs under $3 and is preemption-tolerant because a run is
25 minutes long.

**The staging recommendation is therefore: do Stage A now for free; build the
layer-outer capture path; then B-3 and C-3 for a combined GPU spend under
$7.** The engineering is the price, not the GPU-hours — which is exactly what
the BF16-floor measurement already taught us: *"The measurement cost $18.90 —
but most of that was BUILDING the native-BF16 student mode in stream_score.py,
not measuring."*

---

## 7. Risks, ranked

**R1 — the expert-fusion conversion is 98% of this checkpoint, and
`hf_capture`'s guard cannot see it fail.** *(CLOSED by Stage A -- 836/836
tensors byte-exact, and the guard now reads `conversion_errors`. See section 9.3
and 9.4. The `down_proj` shape stated below is wrong; see section 9.2.)* `GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` holds routed
experts as fused 3-D parameters (`experts.gate_up_proj` `[256, 4096, 6144]`,
`experts.down_proj` `[256, 2048, 6144]`) while the checkpoint ships one matrix
per expert per projection. A naive key-set diff reports **150 missing keys**;
they are saved only by `conversion_mapping.py`'s `glm_moe_dsa` entry
(`MergeModulelist(dim=0)` + `Concatenate(dim=1)`), which I confirmed exists in
transformers 5.16.1 and which is why Fruit — same per-expert layout — loaded.
**57,600 of the checkpoint's 59,585 tensors (96.7%) are consumed by that
converter** and collapse into 150 fused parameters; a further 791 (all of
layer 78) are legitimately unexpected; only 1,194 load by name.

Now the sharp edge: `LoadStateDictInfo.to_dict()` — the exact dict
`output_loading_info=True` hands `hf_capture` — **deliberately omits
`conversion_errors`** ("to be coherent with legacy reporting in the tests"). And
`hf_capture.missing_weight_keys` reads **only** `missing_keys`, ignoring
`mismatched_keys` (whose loading report says *"Reinit due to size mismatch"* —
a randomly-initialised tensor by another name) and `error_msgs`.

*Mitigation:* Stage A2's byte-for-byte comparison of fused expert rows against
raw shard bytes, plus a scoped hardening of `hf_capture` to refuse on
`mismatched_keys` and `error_msgs` and to log `unexpected_keys` (which here will
legitimately contain layer 78's 791 MTP tensors and must be disclosed, not
refused). Reading `conversion_errors` requires the `LoadStateDictInfo` object
rather than its dict.

**R2 — `hf_capture.py` cannot load this model on any machine JarvisLabs
rents.** *(HALF-CLOSED by Stage A: `--device-map` / `--max-memory` /
`--offload-folder` now exist and skip the fatal `.to()`, proven on
`glm_moe_dsa`. The ECONOMICS below stand unchanged. See section 9.5.)* `load_model` calls `from_pretrained(...)` with no `device_map`, then
`model.to(device)`. With `device_map=None`, transformers materialises 1,486.8 GB
on **CPU**; the largest per-GPU RAM on offer is 300 GB (H200 IN2), so a
single-GPU instance is OOM-killed before it ever reaches `.to()`. And `.to()`
would then move 1,486.8 GB onto one 141 GB card. Even the whole box does not
save it: **8 × H200 = 1,128 GB of VRAM < 1,486.8 GB.** No JarvisLabs
configuration holds this model in VRAM.

*Mitigation:* the `device_map` / `max_memory` / `offload_folder` patch described
in §6 B-1, or the layer-outer engine. Either way this is a **tooling change and
a blocker**, not a runtime surprise. It is also the reason the streaming lane
cannot substitute: `engines/tools/hidden_replay.py` hard-codes `HIDDEN_WIDTH = 4096`
and `import stream_score`, and `stream_score.py` is not in this repository —
`fidelity_dataset.py` already refuses `--engine sealed-lane` for exactly that
reason.

**R3 — CAPTURE-03: would the random-initialisation refusal fire here?**
*(Its blind spot is closed; see section 9.4.)* Yes,
for the failure mode it was built for. `hf_capture.py:390` raises
`REFUSED: N parameter(s) were NOT in the checkpoint and were randomly
initialised` unless `--allow-missing-weights`, and it is reached before the
panel loop, so it costs a load and not a capture. Crucially, **if the fusion
converter fails on any single layer** — an incomplete shard, a truncated
`.incomplete` file, a transformers version without the `glm_moe_dsa` mapping —
that layer's `gate_up_proj` and `down_proj` land in `missing_keys` and the
refusal fires. That is exactly the right behaviour and it is the strongest
argument that this run is safe to attempt. Its blind spot is R1's
`conversion_errors` / `mismatched_keys`.

**R4 — spot preemption on a multi-hour run.** All four paid measurements ran
0 preemptions, but they were 2.8–5.6 h. Stage C on the disk-offload lane is
**15–21 h on a spot instance**, which is a different risk class; the campaign
has already lost ~65 minutes to one external kill at window 22 of 25 (M2).
*Mitigation:* prefer the layer-outer lane, where a run is ~25 minutes and a
preemption costs one run, not a day. Failing that, checkpoint per window (the
capture already writes one safetensors file per window, so resume is a
bookkeeping change, not a compute change) and hold `--max-runtime` low.

**R5 — disk quota.** ~1,548 GB against a 2,048 GB cap is comfortable, but the
disk-offload lane needs ~3.0 TB across two volumes and the campaign has hit
"Disk quota exceeded" twice. *Mitigation:* provision 1,700 GB, keep the
checkpoint on a shared filesystem so the fetch survives an instance restart,
and apply the existing free-space guard pattern from `stage_campaign.sh`.

**R6 — `hf_capture.py` has only ever run on 0.1B and 5B models.** True, and
the gap to 753 B is four orders of magnitude. But the specific things that
break at scale are enumerable and all appear above: the load path (R2), the
fusion conversion (R1), and the per-window re-read (§4). The panel loop, the
hook, the seal, the manifest and the three-step chain are size-independent —
they move `positions × 6144 × 2` bytes and nothing else. *Mitigation:* Stage
A2 exercises every size-independent mechanism at hidden width 6144 for free.

**R7 — the account balance is smaller than one existing-tooling stage C.**
$90.318 against $96.32 (C-1) or $38–52 (C-2, with no margin for a preempted
retry). *Mitigation:* this is the go/no-go, not a risk to mitigate around.
Either the layer-outer engine gets built or the campaign needs a top-up before
stage C.

**R8 — MPS numerics are not CUDA numerics.** The M4 Max fits the 81.7 GB
schedule and has 1.3 TiB free — tantalisingly close, but **1.3 TiB < 1.507 TB**,
so the full checkpoint does not fit locally, and a root captured on MPS would
not be same-lane comparable to CUDA candidates anyway. Use the Mac for Stage A
and nothing else.

---

## 8. Verdict

**GO-WITH-STAGING.**

The model is our architecture, the config holds no surprises, the census
reconciles to zero bytes, the memory fits one H200 three times over, the
checkpoint fits a JarvisLabs disk with 500 GB to spare, and the fetch is an
hour. The refusal that protects us from measuring randomly-initialised weights
is present and would fire on the most likely load failure.

**The single most likely failure mode: `hf_capture.py` cannot load this
checkpoint at all, because it materialises the whole model on CPU and then
calls `.to(device)` — and 1,486.8 GB exceeds both the largest RAM on offer
(300 GB) and the entire VRAM of a full 8× H200 node (1,128 GB).** That is not a
risk that might materialise; it is a certainty that will halt stage B on the
first attempt unless the engine is changed first. Everything else in this
document is arithmetic; this is the one thing that must be built.

Spend nothing until Stage A is done. It is free, it runs on the operator's own
desk, and it is the difference between finding R1 for $0 and finding it for $50.

---

## 9. Stage A: what it actually proved (run 2026-08-30, $0.00)

Stage A ran end to end on the operator's M4 Max. **No GPU was rented, nothing
was published, no registry row was written, and no number produced here is a
measurement.** The model it ran on is four layers deep; its KLD is arithmetic
about a truncation, not fidelity.

**Verdict: GO for Stage B.** R1 — the risk this stage existed to close — is
closed, with counts rather than a summary. R3's guard was widened to see the
three failures it was blind to. R2's *mechanism* is now fixed and proven on the
real architecture; R2's *economics* are unchanged and remain the gate on
Stage C.

### 9.1 What was fetched, and what it cost

`engines/tools/fetch_truncated_ckpt.py` (new) range-fetches only the byte ranges of
the tensors a truncated model needs, writing them at their published offsets
into **sparse** local shards under the published safetensors headers.

| | planned in §6 | actual |
|---|---:|---:|
| shards touched | 9 | 9 |
| download | 43.2 GB (whole shards) | **25.948 GB** |
| tensors kept | — | **836** |
| wall clock | — | **4m 53s** at 91 MB/s |
| on-disk after | — | 24 GB (sparse; 43.2 GB apparent) |
| dollars | $0.00 | **$0.00** |

Whole-shard fetching would have moved 17.2 GB it never reads: five of the nine
shards carry wanted tensors and unwanted ones side by side (shard 2 holds
**one** layer-1 tensor and 211 layer-10 tensors). Range fetching is the right
tool here even though §3 correctly rules it out for the *full* capture.

Truncated model: 4 layers (0–2 dense, 3 sparse with all 256 routed experts),
**12,973,900,544 parameters = 25,947,801,088 bytes**. The fetch plan's
25,947,802,112 bytes exceeds it by exactly **1,024 bytes** — `mlp.gate.`
`e_score_correction_bias`, 256 fp32 values, a buffer rather than a parameter.
The census reconciles at this scale too.

### 9.2 Two corrections to §6 and §7

**§6's Stage A recipe does not load as written.** Setting only
`num_hidden_layers: 4` is refused by `transformers` 5.16.1:

> `ValueError: num_hidden_layers (4) must be equal to the number of mlp_layer_types (78)`

The per-layer schedule lists must be truncated with it. `fetch_truncated_ckpt.py`
truncates every config value that is a 78-long list of strings —
`mlp_layer_types` and `indexer_types` — which preserves the schedule of the
layers kept: `dense, dense, dense, sparse` and `full, full, full, shared`. So
layer 3 is still a `shared` indexer consuming layer 2's `prev_topk_indices`,
exactly as in the 78-layer model.

**§7 R1 states the fused shape wrong.** `down_proj` is `[256, 6144, 2048]`
(`[E, hidden, moe_intermediate]`), not `[256, 2048, 6144]`. `gate_up_proj` is
`[256, 4096, 6144]` as stated. The confirmed converter is

```
["mlp.experts.*.gate_proj.weight", "mlp.experts.*.up_proj.weight"]
    -> mlp.experts.gate_up_proj   via MergeModulelist(dim=0), Concatenate(dim=1)
 "mlp.experts.*.down_proj.weight"
    -> mlp.experts.down_proj      via MergeModulelist(dim=0)
```

and `modeling_glm_moe_dsa.py:571` splits the *output* of
`linear(x, gate_up_proj[k])` with `.chunk(2, dim=-1)`, so rows `0:2048` are
gate and rows `2048:4096` are up.

### 9.3 R1 — CLOSED. The converter is honest, byte for byte

`engines/tools/verify_fused_experts.py` (new) loads the checkpoint through
`hf_capture.load_model` — the production path — then reads each per-expert
matrix's raw bytes straight out of the local shard at its published offset,
with no `safetensors` reader and no `transformers` in the path, and `memcmp`s
it against the corresponding slice of the live fused parameter.

| comparison | count | differed |
|---|---:|---:|
| `gate_up_proj[k][0:2048]` vs `experts.k.gate_proj.weight` | 256 | **0** |
| `gate_up_proj[k][2048:4096]` vs `experts.k.up_proj.weight` | 256 | **0** |
| `down_proj[k]` vs `experts.k.down_proj.weight` | 256 | **0** |
| every other parameter and buffer, name-mapped 1:1 | 68 | **0** |
| **total checkpoint tensors compared** | **836** | **0** |

836 compared, 836 exact, and 836 of 836 is every tensor fetched. The fetch
receipt's per-tensor sha256 were re-derived from the shard bytes at check time:
768 re-checked, 0 mismatched. The two parameters with no checkpoint key are
`model.rotary_emb.inv_freq` and `.original_inv_freq` — computed from the
config, never shipped, correctly absent.

**The same check passes through the `--device-map` path** (`{"": "cpu"}`,
`accelerate` 1.14.0): 836/836 exact. Dispatching does not change the converter's
output.

The load report, read in full:

```
observed true   conversion_errors_visible true
missing_keys 0   mismatched_keys 0   error_msgs 0   conversion_errors 0
unexpected_keys 43
```

**The 43 unexpected keys are not what §7 predicted, and the reason matters.**
They are not layer 78's MTP tensors — they are tensors of layers 9, 10, 19, 20,
29 and 30 that happen to share the nine fetched shards. `transformers` 5.16.1
enumerates each shard's **own safetensors header**, not merely the
`weight_map` of the index, so a pruned index does not stop it from finding —
and running the fusion converter over — tensors it encounters in the file. In
this sparse tree those regions are holes that read as zeros. They were
classified `UNEXPECTED` and discarded, so nothing was harmed. But that is
precisely the mechanism by which a hole could have been served as a tensor of
zeros had a key matched, and it is why the instrument for R1 has to be a byte
comparison and not a key-set diff. On the full Stage B tree the same field will
legitimately carry layer 78's 791 MTP tensors.

### 9.4 R3 — the guard now sees what it needed to see

`hf_capture.py` read `missing_keys` and nothing else. It now reads the whole
report, through `load_report()` and `refuse_on_load_report()`:

| signal | before | now |
|---|---|---|
| `missing_keys` | refuses (`--allow-missing-weights` overrides) | unchanged |
| `mismatched_keys` (*"Reinit due to size mismatch"*) | **ignored** | refuses, same override |
| `error_msgs` | **ignored** | refuses, **not** overridable |
| `conversion_errors` | **not even visible** | refuses, **not** overridable |
| no report at all | read as a clean report | refuses, not overridable |
| `unexpected_keys` | never recorded | **refuses** (`--allow-unexpected-tensors` overrides, forcing a BLOCKING disclosure) |

**`unexpected_keys` was a disclosure and is now a refusal, as of M1.5.** The
disclosure was written for the benign reading — GLM-5.3-BF16 ships an MTP layer
`GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM` does not build, 791 tensors of it. M1 found the other
reading: `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` loads with `unexpected: 64` because the
producer's `modules_to_not_convert` lists `...mlp.gate` and
`should_convert_module` matches it with a start-anchored `re.match`, so
`...mlp.gate_proj` matched too. 65 of 65 `gate_proj` modules skipped FP8
conversion, their block scales fell out as "unexpected", and the projection ran
on fp8 bytes read as bf16 with the scale never applied. Nothing raised. The two
readings are indistinguishable from inside the loader, so the tool refuses and
makes the operator say which one it is. **Consequence for the GLM-5.3 root
capture: it will need `--allow-unexpected-tensors` for the MTP layer, and the
sealed dataset will carry `unexpected_tensors_overridden` at `blocking`.** That
is a label on the dataset; it does not propagate into a comparison receipt and
does not block a registry row.

`conversion_errors` is reachable because `_FullLoadingReport` wraps
`LoadStateDictInfo.to_dict` for the duration of the load — the method whose own
source says it omits the field *"to be coherent with legacy reporting in the
tests"*. If a `transformers` build offers no such class, the wrap does not take
effect and the guard **refuses** rather than reporting a clean bill of health it
never checked.

Two honest qualifications. First, `transformers` 5.16.1 already raises from
inside `from_pretrained` on both `conversion_errors` and `mismatched_keys`, so
on this build the load fails either way — the old code failed closed here, with
a confusing message. The hardening matters because that is the library's
choice, not ours: `ignore_mismatched_sizes=True`, an older build, or a
refactor all hand the report back instead of raising, and then this reader is
the only thing between a reinitialised tensor and a published number. Second,
`_from_pretrained` used to return a bare `{}` on its fallback path, so an
**unexamined** load and a **clean** load were the same value. That one was live.

Regression tests A17–A22 in `bin/selftest_hf_capture.py`; all six fail against
`hf_capture.py` at commit `b3f518c` (verified by running the new selftest
against a `git archive HEAD` tree) and pass after. A17's failure there reads
`missing_weight_keys -> []` on a report carrying a mismatched key: the blind
spot, stated.

### 9.5 R2 — mechanism fixed, economics unchanged

`load_model` now accepts `device_map` / `max_memory` / `offload_folder`, and
**skips the `model.to(device)`** that follows `from_pretrained` when a
`device_map` is given, because `.to()` on a dispatched model raises. Proven on
`glm_moe_dsa` itself, not only on a fixture (§9.3). It refuses with a clear
message when `accelerate` is absent instead of surfacing the library's.

That unblocks the B-1 and B-2 lanes. It does **not** change their prices, and
the layer-outer engine of B-3/C-3 is still unbuilt. §6's cost table stands.
*(Superseded 2026-08-30: the layer-outer engine is now built and proven. See
§10 and `docs/LAYER-OUTER.md`.)*

**A new number for the Stage B budget: the converter's transient is one layer,
not three.** Loading the truncation peaked at **48.2 GB RSS** against
25.95 GB of resident parameters — a **22.3 GB** excess, or 1.15x the 19.33 GB
of one sparse layer's routed experts. So the fusion holds roughly the source
copy of the layer it is building and not more. Budget **one extra sparse-layer
buffer (~19.4 GB) of headroom above resident during load**, per layer in
flight. Caveat: safetensors mmaps the shards, so an unknown part of that 22.3 GB
is evictable file-backed page cache rather than anonymous memory — treat 19.4 GB
as an upper bound, not a floor.

### 9.6 The capture chain, on `glm_moe_dsa` at hidden width 6144

Two cold captures in two separate processes, through
`bin/fidelity-dataset capture --engine hf-transformers`:

| | |
|---|---|
| windows / scored positions | 2 / 4,094 |
| per window | 70.8 s, 67.6 s (CPU, M4 Max) |
| total per run | 158.2 s |
| head hook | fired **exactly once** per window |
| head input | `[1, 2048, 6144]`, **bfloat16**, bias `None` |
| hidden form / logit-form equivalent | 50.3 MB / 2.54 GB (50.4x) |
| `verify` | VERIFIED, tensors recomputed |
| `validate --strict` | **0 errors, 0 warnings** |
| `capture_content_digest`, both runs | `faa26e5ac6…` — **identical** |
| `compare --self-compare` | **exactly 0.0** (SC-1) |

Every gate in §6's *Gate A → B* passes: `missing_keys`, `mismatched_keys` and
`error_msgs` all empty; the fused expert bytes match the shard bytes exactly;
the head hook fired once; the hidden dtype is bf16.

The sealed manifests carry three disclosures — `no_known_deviations`,
`reduced_run_count`, and the new `checkpoint_tensors_not_loaded` naming the 43
unused tensors. Evidence lives in `engines/tools/glm53-stagea-evidence/`. **The
datasets themselves were deleted**: they are a truncation, they are not a
measurement, and nothing should be able to mistake them for one.

### 9.7 What Stage B should now cost, and the one thing still unknown

Nothing learned here moves §6's price table: the fetch is still ~1 h and
$0.40–0.56, and B-1/B-2/B-3 still cost $51.76 / $13.77–18.04 / $2.45–2.93. What
changed is *risk*, not price:

* R1 no longer needs paid discovery. The converter was exercised on a real
  sparse layer with all 256 experts and was exact. The remaining 75 sparse
  layers go through the identical layer-agnostic code path.
* R2's blocker is no longer "the engine cannot express this". B-1 and B-2 are
  runnable today with the `device_map` flag.
* Stage B should add `--max-memory` headroom of one sparse-layer buffer
  (~19.4 GB) above its resident plan, per §9.5.
* Stage B must not reuse this panel. `panel--glm53.stagea.smoke.2w` is two
  windows built to exercise a code path; §5's 25-window, 5-stratum panel is
  still the recommendation.

**The single biggest remaining unknown is unchanged and is the one §8 named:
no engine reads this checkpoint economically.** `device_map` makes the load
*expressible*, not cheap — B-1 spills ~334 GiB to CPU RAM and pays a 358 GB
pageable H2D transfer per window; B-2 writes a second full 1,486.8 GB copy to
disk. The layer-outer, window-inner schedule that reads the tree once per run
instead of once per window is still the difference between a $3 stage C and a
$38–96 one, and it is still unwritten. Stage A moved the correctness risk to
zero and left the engineering exactly where it was.

## 10. Stage A → the engine (built 2026-08-30)

**§9.7's closing sentence is no longer true, and this section is here so nobody
reads it as current.** The layer-outer, window-inner engine exists:
`engines/tools/layer_outer.py`, driven by
`hf_capture.py --schedule layer-outer`. It is proven **bit-identical** to the
window-outer schedule — the same `capture_content_digest` — on both the 0.1B
`glm5_next` fixture and `malaiwah/GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit-bf16` (`glm_moe_dsa`, this
model's architecture), on CPU and on CUDA, with
`compare --self-compare --force-compute` returning exactly 0.0 nats.

Two numbers in this document change as a result, both in the safe direction,
and one of them changes because the engine's residency split is finer than §2
assumed:

| | this document | measured/implemented |
|---|---:|---:|
| peak VRAM, GLM-5.3, 25 windows | 81.7 GB (§2) | **~47–51 GB** |
| minutes per window | 13–26 (§4, window-outer) | **0.4–1.6** |
| Stage C cost | $2.45–2.93 (C-3, §6) | **$1.08–3.52**, confirmed |

§2's 81.7 GB assumed the whole **non-routed set (37.78 GB)** stays resident and
only the routed experts stream. The engine streams *whole layers* — attention,
shared expert, router, DSA indexer, norms and routed experts together — so only
`embed_tokens + lm_head + model.norm` (3.81 GB) is permanently resident and the
weight peak is 3.81 + one layer (19.76 GB) = **23.56 GB**. The rest of the
budget is the expert-fusion transient §9.5 upper-bounded at 22.3 GB, which is
now the dominant and least-measured term.

Full evidence, the two digest proofs, the measured memory tables, what the
schedule does **not** handle, and what would falsify the projection:
**`docs/LAYER-OUTER.md`**. Raw receipts:
`engines/tools/layer-outer-evidence/`.

**Stage B is unchanged as a decision and is not taken here.** No GLM-5.3
capture has been run.
