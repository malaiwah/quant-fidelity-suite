# Quantization Fidelity Registry

A public, schema'd, receipt-backed, cross-model index of **quantization quality measurements**.

It exists to answer one question that nothing else answers today: *show me every measured quant of
model X, with its fidelity number and enough provenance to know whether that number means anything.*

It is the sibling of [`0xSero/local-ai-registry`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/0xSero/local-ai-registry),
which answers *how fast, how much VRAM, how much money*. This one answers *how faithful*. Ids and the
`huggingface` identity block are deliberately shaped so records can be cross-linked; every artifact,
model, panel and pipeline carries a `cross_refs.local_ai_registry` slot, and a link is never presented
as verified unless it has been.

## The rule this registry exists to enforce

> **Two fidelity numbers with different `comparability.key` values are NEVER comparable. Equal keys
> make two rows *candidates* for comparison — a necessary condition, not a certificate. Before
> ranking rows as like-for-like, check the group's machine-readable `comparability` predicate in
> `index.json`.**

(Until 2026-08-31 this rule was stated as an "if and only if". The *only-if* half was always true
and still is. The *if* half was never true, and an independent peer review said so with this
registry's own receipts: the key deliberately omits the measurement **lane** — one artifact in
group `cmp--202b717f3219c414` is measured on two lanes, differing in the fourth decimal; the
candidate **pipeline** — the same checkpoint/panel/teacher has measured ~24% apart through two
pipelines; **hardware** — a measured A100-vs-H200 term of 2.97e-4 nats is ~13x the gap between two
published 4-bit quantizers ([ARCHITECTURE-DETERMINISM](https://github.com/malaiwah/quant-fidelity-suite/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE-DETERMINISM.md));
and artifact **scope** — a routed-experts-only quant and a full-forward GGUF at "the same" bpw are
different interventions. The omission is deliberate — hashing hardware into the key was considered
and rejected, because it would explode the partition into single-row groups — but deliberate is not
the same as sufficient, and the contract now says which it is. The key itself is **unchanged and
unversioned**: rehashing it would regroup every published row and orphan every key a third party
has cited. What changed is the claim made about it, plus a machine-readable predicate per group:
`comparable: true/false/unknown` with reasons, in `index.json`, recomputed by the validator
(`CMP-007`) so a hand-edited predicate is rejected exactly like a forged key.)

A bare `kld: 0.027` is worse than nothing. A KL divergence is only meaningful relative to a specific
set of tokens, measured against a specific teacher capture, in a specific direction, at a specific
accumulator precision, through a specific stack relation, with a specific head policy. Change any one
of those and you have a different quantity that happens to be printed with the same units.

So the key is a **hash over exactly those seven things**:

```
comparability.key = "cmp--" + sha256("|".join([
    panel_id,            # WHICH TOKENS, including the scored-position policy
    reference_id,        # WHICH TEACHER CAPTURE (a capture, not a model: artifact + panel + stack + precision)
    metric_name,         # mean_tokenwise_kld, mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld, ...
    direction,           # reference_to_candidate (KL(P_teacher || Q_student)) or the reverse
    accumulation_dtype,  # float64 vs float32 over 10M positions is a different estimator
    stack_relation,      # same_stack, or cross_stack (which carries a known upward bias)
    head_policy,         # the candidate's own lm_head, or one shared head applied to both sides
]))[:16]
```

`tools/registry_validate.py` recomputes this key for every row from the row's own fields and rejects a
mismatch (`CMP-001`). A hand-written key cannot move a number into a table where it does not belong.
`tools/registry_render.py` groups tables by that key and by nothing else, and `--check` fails if the
committed README differs from what the data renders. **The tables below are a pure function of
`data/*.jsonl`.** They were never typed by hand and cannot drift.

### A worked example: one valid comparison and one invalid one

Five numbers, all for GLM-5.3-Flash, all on brandonmusic's sealed 25-window / 51,175-position panel,
all against the same stored fp32 teacher logits, all KL(teacher || student) in nats, all accumulated
in float64. They are printed as **two tables, not one**, because they are two quantities. A reader who
skims tables rather than paragraphs should be stopped by the layout, not only by the prose underneath
it:

**Group `cmp--202b717f3219c414`** -- sealed-lane same-stack capture, five cold runs each. These three may
be ranked against one another. (This group holds five rows today; the other two came off a different
measurement *lane* and are the subject of the section after next.)

| | value | metric | stack_relation |
|---|---:|---|---|
| malaiwah TR3 6bpw (K6), 253.5 GB | 0.013723384665701147 | `mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld` | `same_stack` |
| brandonmusic tr3 4bpw, 175.6 GB | 0.024554564249958208 | `mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld` | `same_stack` |
| 0xSero EXL3 Q4 (Dione), 187.6 GB | 0.027262784814670614 | `mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld` | `same_stack` |

**Group `cmp--4a8630bdcadab97f`** -- **a different quantity, not a continuation of the table above.**
Single-pass cross-stack replay against that same stored teacher. These two may be ranked against each
other and against nothing above them.

| | value | metric | stack_relation |
|---|---:|---|---|
| BF16 replay (the floor) | 0.012711599817250710 | `mean_tokenwise_kld` | `cross_stack` |
| official FP8 (our replay) | 0.020615254540417995 | `mean_tokenwise_kld` | `cross_stack` |

Note the sizes in the first table. K6 leads it, and K6 is also the largest artifact in it by 66 GB.
Rank within a comparability group is a fidelity ordering, not a value judgement: fidelity is bought
with bits, and a table sorted by fidelity alone will usually put the biggest quant on top. The
question worth asking of these three is not which is first, it is what the 4bpw pair cost relative to
each other -- 0.024555 against 0.027263 at 175.6 GB against 187.6 GB.

**VALID:** *"On brandonmusic's 25-window panel, our K6 (0.013723) is closer to the BF16 teacher than
his 4bpw (0.024555), which is in turn closer than the Dione Q4 (0.027263)."*
Same key. Same tokens, same teacher, same estimator, same surface. The comparison is exactly what the
numbers are for. (One of the three is his own measurement on his own stack, so the row is marked
`advisory` and the table says so -- but the panel and the teacher are provably identical, because his
receipt's `token_panel_receipt_sha256` and `teacher_receipt_sha256` are byte-identical to ours.)

**INVALID:** *"The official FP8 release (0.020615) beats his 4bpw (0.024555) and loses to our K6."*
Different key -- and it differs on two axes at once. The FP8 number came from replaying the model through **our** vLLM stack and scoring it
against a teacher captured on **his** transformers/eager stack. That is a `cross_stack` measurement and
it carries a stack-difference term on top of the quantization error. We know how big that term is,
because we measured it on the same panel: replaying the reference's own **unquantized BF16 weights**
through our stack scores **0.012712** against those same teacher logits. So 0.020615 is an upper bound,
not a result. The naive difference is 0.007904 -- an *estimate*, not an identity, because KL is not
additive. **This registry does not subtract floors and publish the remainder.** It puts the floor in
the table, in bold, labelled, immediately above the biased row.

### And one comparison the key alone does not stop

A comparability key has seven inputs and none of them is the measurement lane. Two rows can therefore
share a key -- same panel, same teacher, same metric, same direction, same float64, same
`same_stack`, same `native_head` -- and still have been produced on different machines by different
code paths. Group `cmp--202b717f3219c414` now contains exactly that: our K6 measured on the sealed
8x H200 lane at **0.013723384665701147**, and the *same weights* measured on a one-GPU streaming lane
at **0.013714888822596553**. Sorted into one list, the streaming row lands above the sealed one and
reads as a better quant. It is not a quant at all: it is one artifact, measured twice.

So the renderer tables a non-sealed lane's rows apart from the rest of its group, and the lane's
pipeline record carries the *measured* bridge to the sealed lane rather than an adjective: signed
delta **-8.4958e-06** nats on the panel mean, worst single window **2.8735e-04**,
`tokenwise_kld_sha256_matches_sealed: false`, `publishable_as_reproduction: false`. The last two are
the load-bearing ones. A mean that agrees to five decimal places is not a reproduction when the
per-token array underneath it differs, and the lane says so about itself.

That bridge is one artifact's, on one panel, and it is not subtractable. The 8bpw row in the same
lane has no sealed-lane sibling to bridge against, so its bias block records the offset as
`direction: unknown` and its magnitude as null -- which is what "we do not know" looks like when it
has to survive a schema.

The streaming lane also carries its own floor: the reference's own **unquantized BF16 weights**,
scored through this SAME streaming harness rather than the cross-stack replay pipeline. It reads
**0.011506** nats -- the cost of comparing across capture stacks plus bf16 non-associativity, with
zero quantization involved -- and it is emphatically NOT the cross-stack floor above (0.012712,
a different pipeline, a different lane, a different comparability key). Unlike the cross-stack case,
this registry DOES publish the netted-out number here, as an *Excess over control (nats)* column in
the lane's own sub-table (named *Attributable (nats)* until 2026-08-31; renamed per peer-review
P1-05, because the difference is not a causal attribution): K6-stream nets to 0.002209, K8-stream
to 0.000878. No ratio of those two residuals is published -- the old "2.52x" headline is withdrawn,
because a ratio of small residuals magnifies control error and carried no uncertainty. It is still
an estimate, not an identity -- KL is not additive -- but both
terms are small, share the same reference, and now also share the same lane, which the cross-stack
pair does not. `BIAS-006` is what keeps the two floors from ever crossing: a floor's
`floor_measurement_ref` must have been measured on the SAME lane as the row naming it, so the
cross-stack floor can never be subtracted from a streaming-lane row, nor this one from a
cross-stack row, even on the rare occasion the two share a comparability key. See
`engines/BF16-FLOOR.md` for the full analysis.

The second differing axis is the metric itself: the K6 / 4bpw / Dione rows are
`mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld` over five cold runs, while the cross-stack rows are a single
`mean_tokenwise_kld` pass. When a measurement is bitwise reproducible those two coincide numerically,
but they are not the same estimator in general -- brandonmusic's own v44 FP8 runs span 0.024016 to
0.024883 -- so the registry keeps them apart rather than assuming determinism it has not evidenced.

Ask the tool rather than reasoning it out yourself:

```
$ python3 tools/registry_validate.py \
    --explain measurement--glm53.k6-6bpw.brandonmusic-final25 \
    --against measurement--glm53.official-fp8.brandonmusic-final25.crossstack

NOT COMPARABLE. Differing comparability-key fields:
  metric_name         mean_of_run_means_tokenwise_kld
                      mean_tokenwise_kld
  stack_relation      same_stack
                      cross_stack
Everything else matches (panel_id, reference_id, direction, accumulation_dtype, head_policy).
measurement--glm53.official-fp8.brandonmusic-final25.crossstack declares bias.direction=upward with floor
measurement--glm53.bf16-replay-floor.brandonmusic-final25 (value 0.01271159981725071). Subtracting floors
is NOT sanctioned by this registry: the floor is context, not a correction.
```

A third case worth stating outright, because it is the one most likely to mislead: the MLX builds are
measured against the official FP8 release **dequantized to BF16**, not against a BF16 teacher. Their
6-bit reads `0.0063`, which is numerically smaller than our K6's `0.013723`. It is not better. It is a
different quantity -- the reference itself is quantized, so the FP8 error sits in the teacher instead of
in the student. Those rows carry `reference_kind: dequantized_from_quant`, a mandatory
`different_reference_kind` disclosure, and a panel marked `undisclosed`. They will never appear in a
table with a `native_bf16` row.

---

## What a row must carry

Every measurement names, and cannot validate without: a **model** and a pinned **artifact**; a **panel**
(its own first-class record: corpus lineage, context and position counts, tokenizer, contamination
guard, scored-position policy, token digest, availability); a **reference** -- modelled as a *capture*
`(artifact, panel, stack, logits precision, head source)`, so naming a teacher has already named a panel;
a **pipeline**; the **KL direction**; the **estimator** precision; the **run count with typed determinism
evidence**; the **measurement scope**; the **provenance**; the derived **comparability key**; and a
non-empty **disclosures** array.

Three of those deserve emphasis, because they are where fidelity registries usually go wrong.

**Determinism needs evidence, not a boolean.** A receipt file's own sha256 proves nothing about
numerics -- report files embed timestamps, paths and run indices, and differ across bit-identical runs.
Only *tensor content* digests can back a determinism claim, and the schema blocks the rest
(`DET-001`). The registry's own data is what taught it: in the K6 five-run receipt the five runs carry
five **different** `student_backend_identity_sha256` values (five genuinely distinct cold executions)
and one **identical** `tokenwise_kld_sha256`. Container hashes would have said "nondeterministic";
tensor content says "bitwise identical". Conversely brandonmusic's v44 FP8 rows report five *distinct*
tokenwise digests and a non-zero spread, and are recorded as not reproducible -- while his v44/v71/v75
NVFP4 rows report a single digest across five runs and are recorded as bitwise identical. Same author,
same panel, opposite verdicts, both evidenced.

**Who measured it is four separate facts, not one.** `provenance.measured_by` is
`self-measured | author-reported | third-party-reported`. `independently_verified` is a *separate*
boolean that is never implied by it, and setting it true requires a verifier who is a different party
than the measurer (`PROV-003`). Whether the *artifact* is ours is a third axis, carried by the
`third_party_artifact_self_measured` disclosure -- the Dione Q4 row is 0xSero's weights and our number,
and the table says exactly that. Whether the *panel* is ours is the fourth. Third-party numbers are
welcome here and are never silently merged with ours.

**Which code produced the number is a field, not a footnote.** Every row carries a `harness` block:
content digests of the computational closure that computed the value -- the estimator, its numerical
support, the surface it read -- enumerated by role, plus the tool versions, reduced to one
`harness_id`. Equal id means byte-identical code; a differing id points at the `code_digests` entry
whose role changed. The commit sha is recorded beside it and deliberately *excluded* from the id,
because a commit changes on a docs edit and an identity that churns for reasons that cannot move a
number stops carrying information. The 72 rows that predate the mechanism (2026-08-30) are listed in
`schema/harness-grandfather.json`, each carrying a `harness_unrecorded` disclosure; that list is frozen,
and a new row without a harness is refused (`HARN-001`). They are not retroactively invalidated -- their
receipts are hashed and their values reproduce -- and their digests are not reconstructed from a later
checkout either, because today's files are not the files that produced them.

**An assertion is a published claim, exactly as much as a number is.** A metric row has always needed a
hashed receipt. A *provenance assertion* -- "this bf16 twin is a direct cast, not a dequantization",
"this NVFP4 config block is inherited from the parent rather than authored" -- needed nothing, and two
such claims reached published dataset cards and registry rows with no source at all. A disclosure that
makes one now sets `asserts_provenance` and carries its own pinned `sources` with an optional `lines`
anchor (`PROV-014`/`PROV-015`/`PROV-016`). Pinned means a commit sha or a digest: `/blob/main/` is
refused outright, because line numbers move and a citation that quietly stops pointing at what it
claimed still reads as evidence.

**Panels are identified by their tokens, and the scoring window is part of that identity.** Our GLM
suite scored from position 0 gives 0.028104; the *same tokens*, the *same artifact*, the *same teacher*,
scored from position 1024, gives 0.018794. A 33% move with nothing changed but which positions were
averaged. So the second one is a separate panel record with `derivation.kind: scoring_window_change`,
therefore a separate comparability key, therefore structurally unable to share a table with the first.

---

## Provenance notes on this seeding

Two things in this data are worth stating plainly rather than burying in a disclosure.

**brandonmusic's 25-window panel is genuinely sealed, and we verified it ourselves.** Its identity is
`panel.json` from his public teacher-logits dataset at revision `95f4fdd9`, sha256
`6bafe3283c54bc9342d0f30aa3199d36032d103feb92c31715be8545362790ff` -- a manifest of 665 windows, each
with its own `token_ids_sha256`, of which 25 carry `role: final`. That digest was recomputed by
downloading the file during seeding and it matches the `token_panel_artifact_sha256` his own panel
receipt declares. The receipt's self-declared digest `0beec577...` is recorded separately in
`identity.panel_receipt_sha256` and is explicitly barred from being used as a token identity or as
determinism evidence (`PANEL-002`).

**That panel's contamination guard is weaker than ours, and the tables say so.** Its only guard is role
separation: the 25 `final` windows come from the same packed corpus as the 384 fit / 128 conditional-fit
/ 64 selection / 64 confirmation windows, and are declared qualification-only. No lexical or n-gram scan
is published. Our v5 suites run a 12-word shingle whole-document pre-exclusion against the calibration
corpus and report 0 hits out of 941 documents scanned, 44 excluded. Those are not the same guard, and
the validator warns whenever a `strict` row rests on a panel whose `contamination.checked` is false
(`PANEL-006`). It applies equally to every row on that panel, so it does not disturb comparisons
*within* it.

## How to read the tables below

20 tables follow, one per comparability group, across 5 models. Three things are true of all of them, and each is a mistake somebody has already made with numbers like these:

1. **A number means nothing outside its own table.** Every table states the seven-part key its rows share. Two numbers under different keys are different quantities that happen to print in the same units.
2. **The smallest number on this page is not the best quant.** Today it is GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit BF16 (the reference export) at 0 nats -- and it is not a quant at all -- those are unquantized weights, read by a second engine, measuring what two engines disagree by. Sorting this file by value and reading off the top is the single easiest way to be wrong with it.
3. **Nothing here compares two models.** A KL divergence is measured over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher. GLM-5.3-Flash's numbers and Qwen3.8-27B's numbers are not on a shared scale and never will be.

Attribution is a column, not a footnote: *measured by us*, *measured by us (their artifact)* and *reported by <name>* are three different epistemic states and the tables never merge them.

## GLM-5.2-SIQ-Fruit

`model--malaiwah.glm-5.2-siq-fruit` -- published by malaiwah. Tokenizer `glm-5.2-siq-fruit`, vocabulary 154880.

### Panel: Fruit held-out fidelity panel v1 -- 16 windows x 2048

> **Panel disclosure -- `weak_contamination_guard`:** Separation from Fruit's training data is asserted at SOURCE level only: the two strata used are not among the nine sources Fruit's card names. No shingle or n-gram scan against the published pretraining shards was run, so incidental overlap through a web-crawl source such as FineWeb-Edu is not excluded.

> **Panel disclosure -- `small_panel`:** 16 windows / 32,752 scored positions. On the one artifact measured here so far the per-window standard deviation is 0.0283 nats around a mean of 0.0387, a standard error near 0.0071. Numbers on this panel cannot separate artifacts that differ by less than roughly 30 percent.

#### Group `cmp--e21ff3b61b1bb2ec` -- 2 rows

**Panel** `panel--fruit.malaiwah.heldout-v1` -- Fruit held-out fidelity panel v1 -- 16 windows x 2048
  16 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **32,752 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `a6d367cc3ba44880...`) -- contamination scan: **NOT RUN**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.fruit-bf16-hf.heldout-v1` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--malaiwah.glm-5.2-siq-fruit-bf16` @ef68013aa6e16453cf52b5b77647f72fbe258c3c
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float64
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `same_stack`, head_policy `shared_reference_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--e21ff3b61b1bb2ec`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: true` -- every secondary dimension (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is recorded and homogeneous. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** Every other table in this file: no other group shares this key. That includes every table for a different model -- a KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher, never a score that can be carried between models.

<details><summary>Disclosures for the rows above (5)</summary>

- `fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The artifact's routed experts are exl3-trellis atoms that stock transformers cannot read, so the candidate capture ran a bf16 reconstruction of them (k6/tools/materialize_exl3_experts.py) rather than the vendor kernel. This is the dequantize-and-run methodology the GGUF/MLX/EXL3 ecosystems use for KLD: it measures the error of the STORED WEIGHTS and isolates it from kernel error. It does not measure Fruit's production path (b12x/SparkInfer + vLLM, fp8/nvfp4 KV, MTP). Decode evidence: the codebook table is bitwise equal to the campaign's independently frozen mcg table on all 65,536 entries; the bit rate read off every one of 8,448 payloads agrees with the producer's tier_bitmap; and the reconstruction error reproduces the ENCODER's own recorded expert_rel_rt_mse with ratio mean 1.00013 over range 0.98902-1.01337. The decode has NOT been proven bitwise against a running exllamav3 kernel, which is why this row is advisory.
- `fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1` **small_panel**: Per-window standard deviation 0.0283 around a mean of 0.0387 over 16 windows, i.e. a standard error near 0.0071. Do not rank this against anything it differs from by less than roughly 30 percent. The two strata differ by nearly 2x on their own (literary 0.0275, scientific 0.0500).
- `fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1` **single_run**: One cold capture of the candidate. Repeatability was established for the reference side only.
- `fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1` **declared_scheme_mismatch**: The artifact's config.json declares NVFP4/modelopt; the stored bytes are exl3-trellis K3/K4. scope_digest describes the bytes.
- `fruit.siq-exl3-k3k4.heldout-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.038737453713514176, population sd 0.028308679654341876, min 0.012369540015856577 (final-0006, literary), max 0.09151472952402755 (final-0009, scientific) over 16 windows. The macro mean over contexts equals the token mean because every window contributes the same 2,047 positions.

`model--qwen.qwen3.8-27b` -- published by Qwen (Alibaba). Tokenizer `qwen3.8`, vocabulary 248320.

### Panel: malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B distribution-fidelity suite v5 -- 5,120 contexts

> **Panel disclosure -- `unsealed_source`:** The qwen38 v5 token suite is pinned by suite_token_sha256 and by its manifest digest c79dfad3..., but the token files themselves are not published, so a third party cannot reproduce the digest today.

#### Group `cmp--c8c4df32774bdb63` -- 6 rows

**Panel** `panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-10m` -- malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B distribution-fidelity suite v5 -- 5,120 contexts
  5120 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **10,480,640 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `510541f6861b589d...`) -- contamination scan: **yes, 0 hits**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-10m` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--qwen.qwen3.8-27b-bf16` @unpinned revision
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float32_reduce_legacy
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `same_stack`, head_policy `shared_reference_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--c8c4df32774bdb63`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: false` -- a RECORDED secondary dimension differs across members: scope. Equal keys make these rows candidates for comparison, not certified like-for-like; ranking across the differing dimension attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope effect to quantization quality. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** The nearest neighbouring groups differ in:

### Panel: malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B suite v5, shards 0-1 -- 1,024 contexts

Derived from `panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-10m` by **shard_subset**: shards 0 and 1 of 10 (1,024 contexts, 495 source clusters).

### Panel: malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B suite v5, shard 0 -- 512 contexts

Derived from `panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-10m` by **shard_subset**: shard 0 of 10 (512 of 5,120 contexts, 330 of 842 source clusters). Different tokens, therefore a different digest and a different comparability key. K6-parity 0.001634 lives here; the FP8 baseline on this panel is 0.005197, NOT the 10M panel's 0.005294.

> **Panel disclosure -- `unsealed_source`:** The qwen38 v5 token suite is pinned by suite_token_sha256 and by its manifest digest c79dfad3..., but the token files themselves are not published, so a third party cannot reproduce the digest today.

This panel carries **3 separate comparability groups**. They are different measurements of different things and are never merged.

#### Group `cmp--75b64be1f101ed22` -- 12 rows

**Panel** `panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-shard0-1m` -- malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B suite v5, shard 0 -- 512 contexts
  512 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **1,048,064 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `caef8a4628d6c07c...`) -- contamination scan: **yes, 0 hits**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--qwen.qwen3.8-27b-bf16` @unpinned revision
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float32_reduce_legacy
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `same_stack`, head_policy `shared_reference_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--75b64be1f101ed22`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: false` -- a RECORDED secondary dimension differs across members: scope. Equal keys make these rows candidates for comparison, not certified like-for-like; ranking across the differing dimension attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope effect to quantization quality. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** The nearest neighbouring groups differ in:
> - `cmp--35a4b2ab8ed5cd50` (4 rows): `stack_relation` same_stack -> cross_stack
> - `cmp--05e16411a5932713` (3 rows): `reference_id` reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m -> reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-hf.suite-v5-shard0-1m; `accumulation_dtype` float32_reduce_legacy -> float64
> - `cmp--c8c4df32774bdb63` (6 rows): `panel_id` panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-shard0-1m -> panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-10m; `reference_id` reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m -> reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-10m
> - `cmp--726ac1b18b8129fa` (5 rows): `panel_id` panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-shard0-1m -> panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-shard0-1m.scorefrom1024; `reference_id` reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m -> reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m.scorefrom1024
> 
> Those numbers are in this file, under their own headings. Quoting one under the other heading is the mistake this layout exists to prevent: the key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction and the estimator, and the validator recomputes it from those fields rather than trusting the stamped value. What that catches is a row filed under a key its own fields do not produce. It does not catch a number attributed to the wrong panel in the first place -- no offline checker can. That is what the receipt digests on every row are for.
>
> Also, and always: **every table for a different model.** A KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher. It is not a quality score that can be carried between models.

**Panel** `panel--qwen38.malaiwah.suite-v5-shard0-1m` -- malaiwah Qwen3.8-27B suite v5, shard 0 -- 512 contexts
  512 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **1,048,064 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `caef8a4628d6c07c...`) -- contamination scan: **yes, 0 hits**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.qwen38-bf16-vllm.suite-v5-shard0-1m` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--qwen.qwen3.8-27b-bf16` @unpinned revision
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float32_reduce_legacy
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `cross_stack`, head_policy `shared_reference_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--35a4b2ab8ed5cd50`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: unknown` -- no recorded difference, but lane, scope are unrecorded for at least one member, so homogeneity cannot be certified. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** The nearest neighbouring groups differ in:
> - `cmp--75b64be1f101ed22` (12 rows): `stack_relation` cross_stack -> same_stack
> 
> Those numbers are in this file, under their own headings. Quoting one under the other heading is the mistake this layout exists to prevent: the key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction and the estimator, and the validator recomputes it from those fields rather than trusting the stamped value. What that catches is a row filed under a key its own fields do not produce. It does not catch a number attributed to the wrong panel in the first place -- no offline checker can. That is what the receipt digests on every row are for.
>
> Also, and always: **every table for a different model.** A KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher. It is not a quality score that can be carried between models.

- `qwen38-hf.fp8-dequantized.suite-v5-shard0-1m` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The vendor FP8 path is unavailable on this hardware: the fused deep-gemm kernel aborts with 'Unknown recipe' on Blackwell. The candidate was therefore captured from a bf16 materialisation of the stored fp8 weights (k6/tools/dequant_fp8.py, w = fp8 * weight_scale_inv over 128x128 blocks, accumulated fp32, stored bf16). This is the dequantize-and-run methodology the GGUF/EXL3/MLX ecosystems use for KLD: it measures the error of the STORED weights, not of the vendor kernel. Validated before use: per-tensor rel-L2 against the root is 0.0265 uniformly across gate/up/down/q projections, which is FP8 E4M3's expected error and confirms the scale convention.
- `qwen38-hf.fp8-dequantized.suite-v5-shard0-1m` **estimator_scope_narrower_than_artifact**: WEIGHT-ONLY, THEREFORE A LOWER BOUND. The checkpoint declares activation_scheme: 'dynamic', i.e. the served model also quantizes activations per-token at runtime. That term is absent from this measurement, so this value is a LOWER BOUND on the served model's divergence, not the served model's divergence. It is in particular NOT the same quantity as measurement--qwen38.fp8.suite-v5-shard0-1m (0.005197), which ran the real kernel on the vLLM lane.
- `qwen38-hf.fp8-dequantized.suite-v5-shard0-1m` **record_note**: UPSTREAM LOADER DEFECT, ROUTED AROUND. Capturing this artifact through stock transformers silently loads it WRONG. The producer's modules_to_not_convert lists '...layers.N.mlp.gate' -- a MoE router that does not exist in this dense checkpoint -- and transformers.quantizers.quantizers_utils.should_convert_module tests re.match(key, full_name), which is anchored only at the START, so that pattern ALSO matches '...layers.N.mlp.gate_proj'. Verified against the real tensor names: 65 of 65 gate_proj modules excluded from fp8 conversion, 0 of 65 up_proj. Their fp8 weights load into plain bf16 Linears with the block scale never applied, and the 65 gate_proj.weight_scale_inv tensors drop out of the load as 'unexpected' -- the only signal, and nothing refuses on it. The dequantisation used here applies all 407 block scales, and the resulting checkpoint loads with 0 unexpected / 0 missing / 0 mismatched.
- `qwen38-hf.fp8-dequantized.suite-v5-shard0-1m` **single_run**: One cold capture of the candidate. Repeatability was not established for the candidate side. The REFERENCE side is the three-run bitwise-identical capture the floor row uses, and the comparison itself is deterministic offline arithmetic over sealed tensors, so the unrepeated term is the candidate forward pass alone.

> Those numbers are in this file, under their own headings. Quoting one under the other heading is the mistake this layout exists to prevent: the key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction and the estimator, and the validator recomputes it from those fields rather than trusting the stamped value. What that catches is a row filed under a key its own fields do not produce. It does not catch a number attributed to the wrong panel in the first place -- no offline checker can. That is what the receipt digests on every row are for.

> Also, and always: **every table for a different model.** A KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher. It is not a quality score that can be carried between models.

## GLM-5.2

`model--zai-org.glm-5.2` -- published by Z.ai. Tokenizer `glm-5.3`, vocabulary 154880.

### Panel: GLM-5.3 corpus 5-stratum x 5-window panel -- 25 windows x 2048

> **Panel disclosure -- `contamination_unchecked`:** No overlap scan against GLM-5.3's pretraining data is possible; the five strata are public web text. This affects what the KLD means about the model, not the comparison between two artifacts of it.

> **Panel disclosure -- `small_panel`:** 25 windows / 51,175 scored positions. On the two 4-bit-class artifacts measured so far the per-window means spread over an order of magnitude (K4: median 0.0030, p95 0.20). Rank artifacts on this panel by the paired per-window difference, never by a single window.

#### Group `cmp--6ccc41df40f849da` -- 6 rows

**Panel** `panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1` -- GLM-5.3 corpus 5-stratum x 5-window panel -- 25 windows x 2048
  25 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **51,175 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `f09ee395f635225a...`) -- contamination scan: **NOT RUN**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.glm-5.2-bf16-hf.corpus5x5-v1` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--zai-org.glm-5.2-bf16` @cf457fa734ab149ffef225f80893eb38c6ff5cdc
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float64
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `same_stack`, head_policy `native_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--6ccc41df40f849da`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: false` -- a RECORDED secondary dimension differs across members: scope. Equal keys make these rows candidates for comparison, not certified like-for-like; ranking across the differing dimension attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope effect to quantization quality. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** Every other table in this file: no other group shares this key. That includes every table for a different model -- a KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher, never a score that can be carried between models.

<details><summary>Disclosures for the rows above (13)</summary>

- `glm-5.2.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The candidate was captured from a bf16 materialisation of the stored fp8 weights: every fp8_e4m3 tensor is decoded on the host with its 128x128 weight_scale_inv block scale (fp8-block-dequant-to-bf16, accumulated fp32, stored bf16) BEFORE it reaches the loader, so no scale can be silently dropped. This is the dequantize-and-run methodology: it measures the error of the STORED weights, not of a vendor kernel.
- `glm-5.2.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` **activation_quantization_not_captured**: WEIGHT-ONLY: the checkpoint declares activation_scheme dynamic, so a served W8A8 deployment also quantizes activations per token at runtime. That term is absent here, so the value is expected to understate the served divergence; it is not a mathematical bound on a mean KL.
- `glm-5.2.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.025368987988553689, population sd 0.013813714764382682, min 0.004672180887474375 (final-0012, literary), max 0.072812005506925861 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows; the token mean is the published value. NEW GROUP: scored against the GLM-5.2 same-lane root reference--malaiwah.glm-5.2-bf16-hf.corpus5x5-v1, not against the GLM-5.3 root -- do not read it beside a GLM-5.3 row on this panel.
- `glm-5.2.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. Every GGUF tensor is dequantized to bf16 on the capture host (gguf-dequant-to-bf16), k-quant block traits read from the tensor tables themselves. The decoder is proven BITWISE against gguf-py 0.19.0's own gguf.quants.dequantize on real fetched blocks (engines/tools/gguf-evidence/), so the DECODE is not in question. What is absent is the serving engine: llama.cpp runs these weights through its own kernels and its own KV-cache quantization. This row is advisory because it measures the STORED WEIGHTS, not a llama.cpp deployment. There is no activation-quantization caveat: a GGUF k-quant build declares none.
- `glm-5.2.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` **quantized_head**: HEAD-1d with a QUANTIZED head: this build's lm_head is Q8_0, so the candidate replayed through its own dequantized head (b957bc5d2be8...) and the reference through the official bf16 head (a012be05e771...). The head's own quantization error is inside this value -- unlike every other GLM-5.2 row, whose head is the official tensor byte for byte. Read the difference against them as codec-plus-head, not codec alone.
- `glm-5.2.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.031466114090875824, population sd 0.015674312649714767, min 0.0071216832934662792 (final-0012, literary), max 0.081442432684445523 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows; the token mean is the published value. NEW GROUP: scored against the GLM-5.2 same-lane root reference--malaiwah.glm-5.2-bf16-hf.corpus5x5-v1, not against the GLM-5.3 root -- do not read it beside a GLM-5.3 row on this panel.
- `glm-5.2.nvfp4-nvidia.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The 57,600 routed-expert NVFP4 component sets are decoded to bf16 per module before the loader (nvfp4-modelopt-dequant-to-bf16: e2m1 unpack, per-group weight_scale in fp8_e4m3 and the per-tensor weight_scale_2, evaluated in exact fp32 and cast once to bf16). The decoder is proven BITWISE against the ecosystem reference implementation -- compressed-tensors 0.18.0's own unpack_fp4_from_uint8 plus the same LUT/scale math in exact fp32 -- on real range-read tensors of THIS release (max_abs_diff_fp32 exactly 0.0, bitwise after the bf16 cast too; engines/tools/nvfp4-evidence/glm53-nvfp4-parity.json). So the decode is not the reason this row is advisory: the reason is that a weights-only capture runs the STORED weights and not a served NVFP4 kernel.
- `glm-5.2.nvfp4-nvidia.corpus5x5-v1` **activation_quantization_not_captured**: WEIGHT-ONLY. The release ships a static per-tensor F32 `input_scale` beside each of its 57,600 routed-expert modules; a served W4A4 NVFP4 kernel quantizes activations with it and this capture does not.

## GLM-5.3

`model--zai-org.glm-5.3` -- published by Z.ai. Tokenizer `glm-5.3`, vocabulary 154880.

### Panel: GLM-5.3 corpus 5-stratum x 5-window panel -- 25 windows x 2048

> **Panel disclosure -- `contamination_unchecked`:** No overlap scan against GLM-5.3's pretraining data is possible; the five strata are public web text. This affects what the KLD means about the model, not the comparison between two artifacts of it.

> **Panel disclosure -- `small_panel`:** 25 windows / 51,175 scored positions. On the two 4-bit-class artifacts measured so far the per-window means spread over an order of magnitude (K4: median 0.0030, p95 0.20). Rank artifacts on this panel by the paired per-window difference, never by a single window.

#### Group `cmp--fdbd312a2551db89` -- 11 rows

**Panel** `panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1` -- GLM-5.3 corpus 5-stratum x 5-window panel -- 25 windows x 2048
  25 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **51,175 scored positions**, score_from 0
  sealed: **yes** (token digest `f09ee395f635225a...`) -- contamination scan: **NOT RUN**
**Reference (teacher)** `reference--malaiwah.glm-5.3-bf16-hf.corpus5x5-v1` -- native_bf16, artifact `artifact--zai-org.glm-5.3-bf16` @304b8051cfb2b260b61ce0cbe330e02a98e73639
**Metric** mean_tokenwise_kld, direction reference_to_candidate, accumulation float64
**Estimation surface** stack_relation `same_stack`, head_policy `native_head`
**Comparability key** `cmp--fdbd312a2551db89`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: false` -- a RECORDED secondary dimension differs across members: scope. Equal keys make these rows candidates for comparison, not certified like-for-like; ranking across the differing dimension attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope effect to quantization quality. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>
> **Rank is not a verdict.** The table is sorted by fidelity alone, and fidelity buys bits: a larger, higher-bitrate quant will usually sit above a smaller one, which is not news. Read the Size and Codec columns before reading the order, and compare like against like.
>
> **What it is NOT comparable to.** Every other table in this file: no other group shares this key. That includes every table for a different model -- a KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher, never a score that can be carried between models.

<details><summary>Disclosures for the rows above (27)</summary>

- `glm-5.3.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The candidate was captured from a bf16 materialisation of the stored fp8 weights: every fp8_e4m3 tensor is decoded on the host with its 128x128 weight_scale_inv block scale (engines/tools/layer_outer.py fp8-block-dequant-to-bf16, accumulated fp32, stored bf16) BEFORE it reaches the loader, so no scale can be silently dropped (transformers' plain-cast path would drop all of them). This is the dequantize-and-run methodology: it measures the error of the STORED weights, not of a vendor kernel.
- `glm-5.3.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` **estimator_scope_narrower_than_artifact**: WEIGHT-ONLY: expected to understate a served W8A8 deployment; the activation term is not measured. The checkpoint declares activation_scheme: dynamic, so the served model also quantizes activations per token at runtime; that term is absent here. (Wording corrected 2026-09-05: omitting it is expected to understate the served divergence, not a mathematical bound on a mean KL.)
- `glm-5.3.fp8-dequantized.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.022305139008145507, population sd 0.011658841108250139, min 0.0031859275260282391 (final-0012, literary), max 0.066921711801724015 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows. The macro mean over strata equals the token mean to 1e-16 (every window contributes the same 2,047 positions; the two differ only in fp64 summation order); the token mean is the published value.
- `glm-5.3.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. Every GGUF tensor is dequantized to bf16 on the capture host (gguf-dequant-to-bf16) before the loader, k-quant block traits read from the tensor tables themselves. The decoder is proven BITWISE against gguf-py 0.19.0's own gguf.quants.dequantize on real fetched blocks of this repository at this revision (Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0 and the IQ family; engines/tools/gguf-evidence/), so the DECODE is not in question. What is absent is the serving engine: llama.cpp runs these weights through its own kernels and its own KV-cache quantization, and none of that is in this number. This row is advisory because it measures the STORED WEIGHTS, not a llama.cpp deployment.
- `glm-5.3.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` **quantized_head**: HEAD-1d with a QUANTIZED head: this build's lm_head is Q8_0, so the candidate side replayed through its own dequantized head (f5aa1c39b73b...) and the reference through the official bf16 head (864f488a0074...). The head's own quantization error is therefore inside this value -- unlike the three NVFP4 rows, whose heads are the official tensor byte for byte. Read the difference between this row and an NVFP4 row as codec-plus-head, not codec alone.
- `glm-5.3.gguf-unsloth-udq4kxl.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.027546149376942001, population sd 0.014867293502822837, min 0.0022879491144074107 (final-0012, literary), max 0.079814749369237256 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows. The macro mean over strata equals the token mean to 1e-16 (every window contributes the same 2,047 positions; the two differ only in fp64 summation order); the token mean is the published value.
- `glm-5.3.exl3-k4-wrldsuksgo2mars.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The 57,600 routed-expert trellis payload groups are decoded to bf16 per module on the capture device (exl3-trellis-decode-to-bf16: exllamav3's unpack, tile permutation, two Hadamard GEMMs and su/sv scaling, mcg codebook read from each module's own payload, TF32 pinned off and recorded) and the fp8 tensors the release kept are decoded on the host as for the FP8 row -- all before the loader. Decode evidence: the decoder reproduces engines/tools/exl3hf_surface.py:decode_payload_hf bitwise on real payloads (the suite's own reference decoder, not exllamav3's kernel) and the same path reconstructs a real trellis quant against its bf16 source at the expected K4 error (cosine 0.99773, rel_l2 6.74%). The decode has NOT been proven bitwise against a running exllamav3 kernel, which is why this row is advisory.
- `glm-5.3.exl3-k4-wrldsuksgo2mars.corpus5x5-v1` **estimator_scope_narrower_than_artifact**: The fp8 tensors this release kept carry the source's activation_scheme: dynamic; that runtime term is not measured, so this value is expected to understate a served fp8-activation (W8A8) deployment of it.
- `glm-5.3.exl3-k4-wrldsuksgo2mars.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.044803849964949564, population sd 0.026215181142102181, min 0.0072157360961422135 (final-0012, literary), max 0.14520838316901405 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows. The macro mean over strata equals the token mean to 1e-16 (every window contributes the same 2,047 positions; the two differ only in fp64 summation order); the token mean is the published value.
- `glm-5.3.nvfp4-radixark.corpus5x5-v1` **lossy_capture_codec**: RECONSTRUCTED, NOT EXECUTED. The 57,600 routed-expert NVFP4 component sets are decoded to bf16 per module before the loader (nvfp4-modelopt-dequant-to-bf16: e2m1 unpack, per-group weight_scale in fp8_e4m3 and the per-tensor weight_scale_2, evaluated in exact fp32 and cast once to bf16). The decoder is proven BITWISE against the ecosystem reference implementation -- compressed-tensors 0.18.0's own unpack_fp4_from_uint8 plus the same LUT/scale math in exact fp32 -- on real range-read tensors of THIS release (max_abs_diff_fp32 exactly 0.0, bitwise after the bf16 cast too; engines/tools/nvfp4-evidence/glm53-nvfp4-parity.json). So the decode is not the reason this row is advisory: the reason is that a weights-only capture runs the STORED weights and not a served NVFP4 kernel.
- `glm-5.3.nvfp4-radixark.corpus5x5-v1` **activation_quantization_not_captured**: WEIGHT-ONLY. The release ships a static per-tensor F32 `input_scale` beside each of its 57,600 routed-expert modules; a served W4A4 NVFP4 kernel quantizes activations with it and this capture does not. The scales were read and recorded, never applied, so this value is expected to understate a served NVFP4 deployment. It is not a mathematical bound on a mean KL.
- `glm-5.3.nvfp4-radixark.corpus5x5-v1` note: Per-window mean 0.051071074118349193, population sd 0.028140927221610379, min 0.010777822592977302 (final-0012, literary), max 0.14531180338616043 (final-0014, literary) over 25 windows. The macro mean over strata equals the token mean to 1e-16 (every window contributes the same 2,047 positions; the two differ only in fp64 summation order); the token mean is the published value.

### Panel: malaiwah GLM-5.3-Flash suite v5, scored from position 1024

Derived from `panel--glm53.malaiwah.suite-v5-10m` by **scoring_window_change**: score_from 0 -> 1024. Identical tokens, half the scored positions, and a materially different number: 0.028104 becomes 0.018794 on the same artifact and the same teacher. This is the clearest demonstration in the registry that the scored-position policy is part of panel identity.

### Panel: brandonmusic GLM-5.3-Flash sealed qualification panel v1 -- 25 final windows

> **Panel disclosure -- `weak_contamination_guard`:** This panel's only contamination guard is ROLE SEPARATION: the 25 'final' windows are drawn from the same packed corpus as the 384 fit / 128 conditional-fit / 64 selection / 64 confirmation windows and are declared qualification-only. No lexical or n-gram scan is published, and the underlying document provenance is published only as a digest. This is materially weaker than the malaiwah v5 suites, which run a 12-word shingle whole-document pre-exclusion and report 0 hits. Do not describe the two guards as equivalent. It applies equally to every row on this panel, so it does not disturb comparisons WITHIN the panel.

This panel carries **3 separate comparability groups**. They are different measurements of different things and are never merged.

##### Lane `streaming` -- 8 of this group's 11 rows

> **A different lane. Same key, and that is exactly the problem this table solves.** The comparability key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction, the estimator precision, the stack relation and the head policy -- and these rows match the table above on all seven. What they do not share is the machine and the code path that produced the candidate logits, and lanes are not interchangeable. Sorting them into one list would read as a ranking; where the same artifact appears in both, it is one set of weights measured twice, not two quants.
>
> **What the lane is** (from `pipeline--malaiwah.glm53-stream-packed-kld`): **1 device**, expert-parallel width **8 emulated in one process**, routed-expert combine order `fp32`.

> That bridge is one artifact's, on one panel. It is not a constant and it is not subtractable: a row in this table whose artifact has no sealed-lane row has no measured offset at all, and says so in its own bias line.

Until 2026-08-31 this column was named *Attributable (nats)*; the rename is peer-review P1-05, and it is a claim change, not a cosmetic one: the difference D(P||Q_quant) - D(P||Q_control) is not itself a divergence, can be negative, and isolates quantization only if the two paths differ by nothing else -- an assumption this project's own pipeline and hardware studies show is non-trivial. It is an estimate, not an identity: KL is not additive, and the subtraction is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and the same lane. Do not quote a RATIO of two of these numbers without uncertainty: a ratio of small residuals magnifies control error. A row with no floor named shows `--`, not zero: absence of a floor is not evidence the floor is zero. BIAS-002/004/006 guarantee any floor named here shares this row's comparability key, measures unquantized weights, and was measured on this row's own lane -- so this column can never mix a floor from a different panel, a different kind of thing, or a different lane into the subtraction.

> **Bias on GLM-5.3-Flash BF16 @a6c167b6** -- other, direction unknown. THIS ROW IS THE FLOOR for the 'streaming' lane: it replays the reference's own unquantized weights through the SAME streaming harness that scored every other row on this pipeline, so its divergence against the stored teacher logits is the lane's zero-point, not a quantization result. It is NOT the cross-stack floor recorded elsewhere in this registry (a different pipeline, a different lane, a different comparability key) and is never interchangeable with it: subtracting one lane's floor from another lane's row is exactly the mistake BIAS-006 exists to catch. The lane's offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane counterpart to this profile exists to bridge against.

> **Bias on malaiwah GLM-5.3-Flash TR3 8bpw (K8)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane, whose offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is known to be non-zero but was NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against. The lane offset measured for a sibling artifact on this panel is not transferable -- it is a property of the routing, not a constant. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.0008782684041065674 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on malaiwah GLM-5.3-Flash TR3 6bpw (K6)** -- other, direction downward. Lane offset, MEASURED not estimated: this 'streaming'-lane run scores 0.013714888822596553 against the sealed-ep8 lane's 0.013723384665701147 on the same panel, a signed delta of -8.495843104593809e-06 nats (|max| 0.00028735280093581186 on any one of 25 windows). The tokenwise KL array does NOT match the sealed one, and the runner's own verdict is publishable_as_reproduction=False, so this number stands beside the sealed one rather than replacing it. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.0022089662032662542 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on Mia-AiLab GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 TR3 4bpw (byte-identical mirror of brandonmusic's)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane. Unlike every other streaming row, this artifact HAS a sealed-lane sibling to bridge against: the same bytes read 0.024554564249958208 there (author-reported, brandonmusic's own five-run receipt on his own stack), so the streaming-lane number sits +0.000948863 nats from it -- a LANE-PLUS-STACK offset, not a lane offset, because the reader digests differ too (1fb3be87... vs 1ccce446...). This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.01399750501503347 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on turboderp GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 4.05bpw (stock exllamav3, mul1, quantized head)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane, whose offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is known to be non-zero but was NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.014020504296142185 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on 0xSero GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 3.0bpw (Dione, K3, TP4-sliced, native BF16 head)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane, whose offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is known to be non-zero and is NOT measured for this artifact: it has no sealed-lane row to bridge against. Its 4-bpw SIBLING does (measurement--glm53.dione-q4.brandonmusic-final25, 0.027262784814670614 on the sealed lane), but a lane offset is a property of the routing, not a constant, so it does not transfer between rungs of a ladder. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.03899531884609326 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on turboderp GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 2.05bpw (stock exllamav3, mul1, quantized head at 5 bits)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane, whose offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is known to be non-zero but was NOT measured for this artifact. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.11013175411406427 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **Bias on vcruz305 GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 K2 (stock-exllamav3 HF layout, mcg, routed experts only, native BF16 head)** -- other, direction unknown. Measured on the 'streaming' lane, whose offset against the sealed-ep8 lane is known to be non-zero and is NOT measured for this artifact: it has no sealed-lane row to bridge against, and no sibling of its own on either lane. This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.14370363229489977 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane.

> **The same artifact, measured elsewhere in this file.** 4 of the artifacts below also carry a number in another table -- on a different panel, teacher or estimator -- and the widest of those spans 18%. None of the readings is wrong and none is interchangeable with another. Quoting one of them as *the* number for the artifact, without its table, is the misuse this registry exists to make obvious.

<details><summary>Disclosures for the rows above (37)</summary>

- `glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against. This row is itself the streaming lane's measurement floor -- the zero-point the K6-stream and K8-stream rows in this same table subtract to obtain their own excess_over_control (formerly: quantization-attributable error; P1-05) (see their bias blocks).
- `glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25` note: CONTROL ROW / STREAMING-LANE MEASUREMENT FLOOR. Not the cross-stack floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-replay-floor.brandonmusic-final25, 0.012712 nats, pipeline--malaiwah.glm53-crosscheck): a different pipeline, a different lane, a different comparability key -- BIAS-002 already keeps the two apart by key, and BIAS-006 additionally forbids naming one as the other's floor even inside a shared key. Provenance of the fields the summary receipt does not carry: metric.direction and estimator.accumulation_dtype are SUPPLIED as reference_to_candidate / float64, matching every other row on this pipeline, because the scorer is the same unmodified tools/k6_kld_report.py. measurement_scope.scored_positions and contexts are SUPPLIED as the panel's own 51,175 positions over 25 contexts (25 x 2047) -- like the K8-stream row, no verdict receipt exists for this profile to read the window count from. determinism.identical_across_runs is RECOMPUTED from run_means and distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256; the receipt's own bitwise_deterministic flag was checked against that, not copied. cold_run_count (2) was checked against len(run_means) and len(kld_report_sha256), both 2. No clean17 sibling: receipt registry/receipts/malaiwah/stream-bf16-kld.json is scalar-only (run_means + a tokenwise digest, no per_window block), so the calibration-clean scope cannot be recomputed without re-running the measurement.
- `glm53.k8-8bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.k8-8bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against.
- `glm53.k8-8bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: This receipt does not name its lane. Its schema string is malaiwah.glm53-k8-packed-kld-summary.v1 and its profile reads 'k8-tp4' -- neither carries the '-stream-' marker the K6 summary's family name does -- so 'streaming' here is OPERATOR-ASSERTED (operator inventory, 2026-08-28) and not read off the file. It is recorded as the more caveated of the two possibilities on purpose: if the assertion is wrong the row is under-claimed, never over-claimed. Also supplied rather than read: metric.direction, estimator.accumulation_dtype, measurement_scope.scored_positions and contexts -- this family is a scalar summary and states none of them, and unlike the K6 row there is no verdict receipt here to read the window count from. No top-1 agreement was produced for this run. determinism.identical_across_runs is RECOMPUTED from run_means and distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256. comparability.bias.floor_measurement_ref: SUPPLIED by --floor-measurement once the streaming-lane floor row below existed; build_row checked it was measured on this SAME lane before writing the reference (exit 7 otherwise).
- `glm53.k6-6bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.k6-6bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. On this panel the lane's offset against the sealed lane IS measured: -8.495843104593809e-06 nats on the mean (max 0.00028735280093581186 on any one window over 25 windows), and the tokenwise KL array is NOT the sealed one, so the run is not a reproduction of the sealed number.
- `glm53.k6-6bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: Provenance of the fields the summary receipt does not carry. metric.direction and estimator.accumulation_dtype: SUPPLIED -- the k6-stream summary states neither, and both are recorded as the sealed lane's because the scorer is the same unmodified tools/k6_kld_report.py, invoked as --profile k6-stream. measurement_scope.contexts: READ from the verdict receipt's 25-entry per_window array, whose streaming means average to exactly the summary's measured_mean_kld. scored_positions: SUPPLIED as the panel's own 51,175 (25 x 2047), which the equal-weighted window average is consistent with. determinism.identical_across_runs: RECOMPUTED from run_means and distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256; the receipt's bitwise_deterministic flag was checked against that, not copied. The verdict's sealed_mean_kld is bit-identical to the sealed K6 row in this file, which is what makes the delta a comparison of these two rows and not of two unrelated numbers. comparability.bias.floor_measurement_ref: SUPPLIED by --floor-measurement once the streaming-lane floor row below existed; build_row checked it was measured on this SAME lane before writing the reference (exit 7 otherwise).
- `glm53.brandonmusic-4bpw.brandonmusic-final25` **author_reported_only**: Measured and published by brandonmusic on his own stack. We have not re-run it. It is nonetheless unusually well anchored: his receipt's token_panel_receipt_sha256 (0beec577...) and teacher_receipt_sha256 (2ae08117...) are byte-identical to ours, so the panel and the teacher are provably the same. Only the reader differs (1fb3be87... vs our 1ccce446...).
- `glm53.brandonmusic-4bpw.brandonmusic-final25` note: On the single-window sub-panel the same artifact reads 0.022751 -- a 7% swing from 0.024555 over the full 25 windows.
- `glm53.tr3-4bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **byte_identical_redistribution**: The measured bytes are brandonmusic's, redistributed: all 120 shards have the same LFS oid as brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-tr3-4bpw @ 5ab363a8. The mirror was measured rather than the upstream because it pins a revision and the upstream record carries none. Credit for the quantization is brandonmusic's; credit for this number is ours.
- `glm53.tr3-4bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **routed_experts_only_scope**: scope glm53_routed_experts_only, non_routed_dtype_policy official_source_native, head_bits 16, read from the release's own config. Only the routed experts are quantized; all 1,618 non-routed tensors including lm_head are the OFFICIAL ones, verified name-set-equal to the official release's. The stock-exllamav3 rows on this same panel quantize attention, the dense MLPs, the shared experts, the vision tower and the head as well: at ~the same nominal bpw they are measuring a different amount of model.
- `glm53.tr3-4bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.tr3-4bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. Unlike every other streaming row here, this artifact HAS a sealed-lane sibling to bridge against, because the bytes are provably identical to brandonmusic's: the same weights read 0.024554564249958208 there. The +0.000948863 nats between them is a LANE-PLUS-STACK offset, not a lane offset -- his run used his reader (1fb3be87...) and ours uses ours (1ccce446...) -- so it bounds the lane term rather than measuring it.
- `glm53.tr3-4bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: First tr3-published artifact measurable by this suite: the streaming lane gained a reader (stream_score --source tr3, k6/tools/tr3_surface.py) in the same change. The routed decode is the campaign's own -- exl3hf_surface.decode_module over the frozen MCG LUT, proven bitwise identical to calling it directly -- so the codec path is the one the K6/K8 rows on this lane were measured through. The non-routed weights are the ARTIFACT's own, re-sharded VERBATIM by the materializer (1,618 tensors copied, 0 decoded, dtypes preserved) because they share shards with the 148,608 routed payload objects and transformers keys its checkpoint load off the shard files. No official-release weight is in the measured function. 907200 K4 expert matrices were decoded per cold run. Attributable error against this lane's own floor: 0.013997505 nats, versus 0.014020504 for turboderp's 4.05bpw -- the TR3 quant is the tighter of the two at ~the same nominal rate, on a strictly smaller quantized scope.
- `glm53.turbo-4.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **unsealed_source**: seal_disclosure (verbatim from the receipt): unsealed-source scoring: stock exllamav3 releases ship no upstream receipts, reconstruction closures or sealed reader ABI; the packed surface was decoded WITHOUT seal verification (consumed payload sha256s and the immutable repo revision are recorded instead)
- `glm53.turbo-4.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.turbo-4.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **quantized_head**: declared_head_bits 6 (verbatim from the receipt): this artifact's lm_head is itself quantized by the producer, unlike the TR3 artifacts on this panel which keep it native BF16. It is APPLIED natively from the artifact's own weights -- no shared or replayed head -- so estimator.head_policy is native_head; the quantization is artifact identity.
- `glm53.turbo-4.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against.
- `glm53.turbo-4.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: First artifact measured end to end by bin/measure-cloud. The receipt's family name carries no lane marker, so 'streaming' is SUPPLIED by --lane; direction, accumulation dtype, scored positions and context count are supplied too (this family is a scalar summary). determinism.identical_across_runs is RECOMPUTED from run_means and distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256. The non-routed weights are the ARTIFACT's own, dequantized from its shards -- including its 6-bit head -- so no official-release weight is in the measured function; the materialization receipt is 3653c55f0dc729c3fccc6bbe5d8949b55e27517ade5d8c546fec79de03dd1c81. 907,200 K4 expert matrices were decoded per cold run. Top-1 agreement 0.9509916951636541, identical across both cold runs, read from the per-run kld-report.json (the scalar summary family did not carry it at the time this row was written; k6_kld_report now emits it).
- `glm53.dione-q4.brandonmusic-final25` **unsealed_source**: The Dione checkpoint ships no upstream receipts or sealed reader ABI. The packed surface was decoded without seal verification; the immutable revision 99cccdf0... and the consumed payload sha256s were recorded instead (dione_shard_hash_verification: full).
- `glm53.dione-q4.brandonmusic-final25` **artifact_identity_incomplete**: The release's own scope manifest was not parsed into this registry, so the artifact's per-class recipe is recorded as unknown.
- `glm53.dione-q4.brandonmusic-final25` note: The receipt's cold_run_deviation field reads verbatim '5 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)' -- a self-contradictory template string. cold_run_count is 5 and run_means has 5 entries, so five runs is what happened; the string is a receipt-generator defect and is recorded here rather than copied into a disclosure. No clean17 sibling: receipt reports/dione-q4-packed-kld.json is scalar-only (no per_window block), so the calibration-clean scope cannot be recomputed without re-running the measurement.
- `glm53.dione-3.0bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **unsealed_source**: The Dione checkpoint ships no upstream receipts, reconstruction closures or sealed reader ABI, so the packed surface was decoded WITHOUT seal verification. What the release DOES publish is a per-shard sha256 manifest (EXL3_MANIFEST.json), and all 130 shard digests were recomputed on the measurement instance before anything was decoded (dione_shard_hash_verification: full); that, the immutable revision, the local config/index digests and the consumed-payload sha256 census are the provenance anchors.
- `glm53.dione-3.0bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.dione-3.0bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact: no sealed-lane row for it exists to bridge against, and the offset its 4-bpw sibling would give is a property of the routing rather than a constant of the ladder.
- `glm53.dione-3.0bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: Third rung of 0xSero's ladder measured here. His Q4 reads 0.027262784814670614 on the SEALED lane and this 3.0bpw reads 0.050501241465423556 on the STREAMING lane; the two are not directly comparable (different lane, different comparability key) and the registry refuses to net them. Within this lane the excess over the BF16-floor control (formerly: attributable error; P1-05) is 0.03899531884609326 nats. The producer's own RELEASE_STATUS.json marks this release quality: FAIL at their own threshold (their held-out forward KL 0.15251, top-1 0.87285 over 65,504 positions of THEIR panel) -- their number, their panel, their estimator, recorded on the artifact record rather than mixed into this one.
- `glm53.turbo-2.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **unsealed_source**: seal_disclosure (verbatim from the receipt): unsealed-source scoring: stock exllamav3 releases ship no upstream receipts, reconstruction closures or sealed reader ABI; the packed surface was decoded WITHOUT seal verification.
- `glm53.turbo-2.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.turbo-2.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **quantized_head**: declared_head_bits 5 -- lower than the 6 this producer's 4.05bpw and 3.05bpw branches declare. Applied natively from the artifact's own weights, so estimator.head_policy is native_head.
- `glm53.turbo-2.05bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact.
- `glm53.vcruz-k2-2bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **quality_gate_failed**: The panel's gate is mean tokenwise KLD < 0.06 and this row reads 0.15520955491423008 -- 2.6x the threshold, and 3.07x the 3.0-bpw rung immediately above it. The gate is the artifact's verdict, not the measurement's: the run is bitwise deterministic, its two cold runs agree to the last bit, and the number is published exactly as it came out. What it says is that a 2-bit routed-expert quantization of this model diverges by 0.155 nats from its own BF16 source on this panel, at 87.27 % top-1 agreement.
- `glm53.vcruz-k2-2bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **unsealed_source**: The release ships no upstream receipts, no reconstruction closures, no sealed reader ABI -- and no per-shard digest list of its own: no SHA256SUMS, no EXL3_MANIFEST.json. What binds the bytes is the immutable 40-hex revision, the Hub's own per-file LFS content digests at that revision -- a 122-entry list, manifest digest 43a162282c06b19d098029afea4bedc77238026bca28fc514e50e33d827a9b66, captured from the models API BEFORE the rental and recomputed on the instance against the downloaded tree: 122/122 verified, 97,764,515,699 bytes, 0 absent, 0 safetensors on disk uncovered by the list -- plus the artifact's config sha256 163bd0888684f7eaf963ad67cdff3fbdca0749796c0aa5a6e7035816e503ecfc and index sha256 e9dd7cb2f6358843de334baa40ff537b4914721dbaa9c7dab42a386562afce19 recomputed locally and bound into the materialization receipt, and the consumed-payload sha256 census.
- `glm53.vcruz-k2-2bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **reduced_run_count**: cold_run_deviation (verbatim from the receipt): 2 cold runs, not 5 (budget; disclosed)
- `glm53.vcruz-k2-2bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` **non_sealed_lane**: Produced by the 'streaming' lane, not the sealed-ep8 lane. The lane's offset against the sealed lane is NOT measured for this artifact: it has no sealed-lane row, and no sibling on either lane, to bridge against.
- `glm53.vcruz-k2-2bpw-stream.brandonmusic-final25` note: The lowest rate measured on this panel, and the first row here to FAIL the 0.06 gate. 0.15520955491423008 nats at 87.27 % top-1, against 0.050501241465423556 at 93.00 % for the 3.0-bpw rung and 0.025503427634363770 at 95.31 % for 4 bpw: 3.07x the divergence of 3 bpw for 35 % fewer bytes (97.8 GB against 149.6 GB), and 6.09x the divergence of 4 bpw for 44 % fewer bytes. Against this lane's own BF16 floor the excess over control (formerly: quantization-attributable error; P1-05) is 0.143703632294899769 nats. Both cold runs produced identical run means and ONE tokenwise KL digest, so the path is bitwise deterministic; the divergence is the codec, not the harness. Every one of the 907,200 decoded expert matrices was K2 (routed_bits_decode_histogram {K2: 907200}), which is the decode side confirming the release's declared routed-experts-only scope. Per-domain the damage is uneven: axis2_legal 0.2509, axis1_general 0.1727, axis3_code_agentic 0.1272, axis4_reasoning_termination 0.0671 -- a 3.7x spread across domains that the single panel mean hides.

### Panel: brandonmusic panel v1, calibration-clean subset -- 17 of 25 final windows

Derived from `panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25` by **shard_subset**: The 17 of 25 sealed windows whose 13-gram overlap with the calibration-role windows is at or below 0.05. Dropped: final-0003, final-0007, final-0011, final-0015, final-0019, final-0021, final-0022, final-0023. Six of the eight are axis4_reasoning_termination at 37-39% overlap, which removes that domain entirely; the other two (final-0021 at 7.1%, final-0022 at 5.8%) are legal and code-agentic, so this is NOT a whole-domain drop and a 19-window axis4-only exclusion is a DIFFERENT scope. The highest overlap among the retained windows is 4.75% (final-0014), so the 5% threshold separates cleanly but not by much -- it is inherited from brandonmusic and is an open joint decision, not a derived constant.

> **Panel disclosure -- `subset_of_panel`:** 17 of the parent panel's 25 windows, 34799 of 51,175 scored positions. Rows on this panel must never be tabled beside rows on the parent panel: excluding the contaminated windows moves different contributors' numbers in OPPOSITE directions (every malaiwah row falls 12.6-16.2%, brandonmusic's own 4bpw row rises 1.6%).

> **Panel disclosure -- `calibration_panel_overlap`:** This panel exists because the parent's contamination guard was role separation only. The n-gram scan that produced it found one whole domain sharing 37-39% of its 13-grams with calibration-role windows despite clean document-level separation -- the finding is brandonmusic's and the reproduction is ours.

This panel carries **2 separate comparability groups**. They are different measurements of different things and are never merged.

##### Lane `streaming` -- 2 of this group's 4 rows

> **A different lane. Same key, and that is exactly the problem this table solves.** The comparability key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction, the estimator precision, the stack relation and the head policy -- and these rows match the table above on all seven. What they do not share is the machine and the code path that produced the candidate logits, and lanes are not interchangeable. Sorting them into one list would read as a ranking; where the same artifact appears in both, it is one set of weights measured twice, not two quants.

This lane's own measurement floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) is 0.011505922619330299 nats; netting it out gives an estimated excess_over_control of 0.0008782684041065674 nats here (called 'quantization-attributable error' before 2026-08-31, renamed per peer-review P1-05: the difference estimates excess divergence over the same-lane unquantized control and is not a causal attribution) -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive, and it is only meaningful because both terms are small and share the same reference and lane. NO FLOOR ON THIS SCOPE: the same-lane floor (measurement--glm53.bf16-stream-floor.brandonmusic-final25) has a scalar-only receipt with no per-window array, so it cannot be recomputed on the calibration-clean window set.

  17 contexts x 2047 scored positions = **34,799 scored positions**, score_from 0

**Comparability key** `cmp--eee09298c558ab21`
**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: unknown` -- no recorded difference, but lane is unrecorded for at least one member, so homogeneity cannot be certified. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.

Quoting one under the other heading is the mistake this layout exists to prevent: the key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction and the estimator, and the validator recomputes it from those fields rather than trusting the stamped value. What that catches is a row filed under a key its own fields do not produce. It does not catch a number attributed to the wrong panel in the first place -- no offline checker can. That is what the receipt digests on every row are for.

It replays the reference's own BF16 weights through our vLLM stack and scores them against brandonmusic's stored fp32 teacher logits. 0.012712 nats is therefore what two stacks disagree by on identical unquantized weights -- not a quantization result. No floor is named because none exists below it.

> **Bias on GLM-5.3-Flash official FP8** -- cross_stack_capture_replay, direction upward. Teacher captured on brandonmusic's transformers/eager stack, candidate replayed on our vLLM stack. The same-stack BF16 replay floor on this exact panel is 0.012712, so this number is an UPPER BOUND on the FP8 release's own divergence. The naive difference is 0.007904 -- an estimate, not an identity, because KL is not additive. Do not subtract and publish. Scope-matched: this row's floor reference is the clean17 floor, not the panel25 one. Subtracting a floor measured on a different WINDOW SET is the same class of error as subtracting one measured on a different LANE, and this registry refuses both.

### Panel: brandonmusic panel v1, single window final-0000

Derived from `panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25` by **shard_subset**: window final-0000 alone, 1/25 of the parent panel. 2,047 scored positions instead of 51,175. brandonmusic's runtime receipts score this window only. The same artifact reads 0.022751 here and 0.024555 over the full 25 windows, a 7% swing -- which is why this is a separate panel record.

> **Panel disclosure -- `weak_contamination_guard`:** This panel's only contamination guard is ROLE SEPARATION: the 25 'final' windows are drawn from the same packed corpus as the 384 fit / 128 conditional-fit / 64 selection / 64 confirmation windows and are declared qualification-only. No lexical or n-gram scan is published, and the underlying document provenance is published only as a digest. This is materially weaker than the malaiwah v5 suites, which run a 12-word shingle whole-document pre-exclusion and report 0 hits. Do not describe the two guards as equivalent. It applies equally to every row on this panel, so it does not disturb comparisons WITHIN the panel.

> **Panel disclosure -- `subset_of_panel`:** A single 2,047-position window. Numbers on this panel have far wider sampling error than the 25-window panel and must never be tabled beside it.

This panel carries **2 separate comparability groups**. They are different measurements of different things and are never merged.

**Like-for-like predicate** `comparable: false` -- a RECORDED secondary dimension differs across members: pipeline. Equal keys make these rows candidates for comparison, not certified like-for-like; ranking across the differing dimension attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope effect to quantization quality. Machine-readable form with per-dimension values: this key's `comparability` block in `index.json`.

> **What this table is.** Every row here shares the comparability key above: the same tokens, the same teacher capture, the same metric and direction, the same estimator precision, the same stack relation and the same head policy. That makes them CANDIDATES for ranking -- the key is a necessary partition, not a certificate. Whether they are also like-for-like on the dimensions the key omits (lane, pipeline, scope coverage, hardware) is what the predicate line above answers.
>

> 
> Those numbers are in this file, under their own headings. Quoting one under the other heading is the mistake this layout exists to prevent: the key is a function of the panel, the teacher, the metric, the direction and the estimator, and the validator recomputes it from those fields rather than trusting the stamped value. What that catches is a row filed under a key its own fields do not produce. It does not catch a number attributed to the wrong panel in the first place -- no offline checker can. That is what the receipt digests on every row are for.
>
> Also, and always: **every table for a different model.** A KL number is a divergence over one model's own vocabulary against that model's own teacher. It is not a quality score that can be carried between models.

## Using the data

```
data/models.jsonl        the upstream models
data/artifacts.jsonl     one concrete weight set at one pinned revision + a STRUCTURED quantization scope
data/panels.jsonl        the token sets, including scored-position policy, sealing and contamination guard
data/references.jsonl    teacher captures: (artifact, panel, stack, precision, head source)
data/pipelines.jsonl     the measuring and producing stacks
data/measurements.jsonl  the rows
index.json               counts, collection digests, and the comparability-key groups as DATA
schema/*.schema.json     JSON Schema draft 2020-12
schema/invariants.json   the machine-readable rules the validator enforces, with severities
```

Resolver rule: every `*_ref` is the `id` of a record in the collection named by the ref's id prefix
(`model--`, `artifact--`, `panel--`, `reference--`, `pipeline--`, `measurement--`). That is the only
thing a consumer needs to know to join the files.

Query it with one line of `jq` -- the mission's original complaint, answered:

```bash
# every measured quant of GLM-5.3-Flash with its number, panel and who measured it
jq -r 'select(.model_ref=="model--zai-org.glm-5.3-flash")
       | [.metric.value, .artifact_ref, .panel_ref, .provenance.measured_by, .comparability.key]
       | @tsv' data/measurements.jsonl | sort -n

# only rows you may legitimately rank against our K6
jq -r --arg k cmp--202b717f3219c414 'select(.comparability.key==$k)
       | [.metric.value, .artifact_ref] | @tsv' data/measurements.jsonl | sort -n
```

## Tools

```bash
python3 tools/registry_validate.py                  # schema + every invariant, offline, no installs
python3 tools/registry_validate.py --strict --json  # CI mode
python3 tools/registry_validate.py --explain <id> [--against <id>]
python3 tools/registry_render.py [--check]          # regenerate / verify README tables + index.json
python3 tools/registry_add.py from-receipt --receipt R --artifact A --panel P ...
python3 tools/seed_registry.py --check              # the seeded rows are regenerable (see the note below)
make check                                          # validate + render --check + fixtures
```

**What `seed_registry.py --check` does and does not prove.** The 37 Qwen3.8-27B rows are read
live out of their receipt files on every run — the seeder refuses to build if a receipt is
missing — so `--check` genuinely re-derives those values from receipts and byte-compares them.
The 20 GLM-5.3-Flash rows are transcribed literals: their receipts live on the Hub and in
third-party repositories, and this tooling is offline by contract, so for those rows `--check`
proves that `data/` matches `seed_registry.py`, not that `seed_registry.py` matches the receipt.
Each of those rows records its receipt's `sha256`, so the binding is checkable by hand: fetch the
`uri`, hash it, and compare the value at the `field_provenance` pointer. All 20 were checked that
way on 2026-08-28 and all 20 matched at full float64. Nothing in CI rechecks it, because nothing
in CI is allowed to reach the network.

Both tools run on a stock interpreter with **no network and no pip**: `tools/_minischema.py` is a
vendored draft-2020-12 validator covering exactly the keyword subset these schemas use, and it raises
on any keyword it does not implement rather than silently ignoring it. When the real `jsonschema`
library is importable, `--jsonschema-lib both` runs both and the CI job fails if their verdicts differ,
so the vendored one cannot quietly drift.

## Credit

The artifacts and the numbers in this registry mostly belong to other people. Specifically:

- **brandonmusic** built the sealed GLM-5.3-Flash token panel, captured and published the fp32 BF16
  teacher logits that four of our own numbers are measured against, produced the tr3-4bpw checkpoint,
  and measured and published the 4bpw and runtime-image rows on his own stack. The panel and the
  teacher are his work; we are guests on them.
- **0xSero** produced the GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 Q4 (Dione) release. The Q4 number here is ours, the
  artifact is theirs. `local-ai-registry` is also theirs, and this registry is shaped to interoperate
  with it.
- **orcarouter (Continuum AI Corp)** produced the GLM-5.3-Flash MLX builds and reported their own
  fidelity numbers, which are included here as their measurements against their reference, quarantined
  from ours rather than merged into them.
- **turboderp** wrote exllamav3, without which most of the EXL3 artifacts in this registry would not
  exist, and published the Qwen3.8-27B exl3 branches measured here.
- **Z.ai (zai-org)** published GLM-5.3-Flash and its official FP8 release. **Qwen (Alibaba)** published
  Qwen3.8-27B and its FP8 release. **unsloth**, **gittensor-model-hub** and the authors of the
  AWQ-INT4 and MTP-NVFP4 builds produced artifacts we measured.

Where an upstream author's identity could not be established from a receipt, this registry records
`repository: null` and says so, rather than asserting a repo id it cannot back up.
