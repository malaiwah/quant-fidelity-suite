"""Harness identity: which code produced this number.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Every measured value in this registry is a function of some code.  Until this
module there was no field that said *which* code, so a defect found in the
estimator put every published row equally under suspicion and no row could be
cleared.  A peer review left ~130 findings open with the honest note that none
is known to move a published number and none has been individually cleared
either; without a code stamp that liability floats over every row forever.

With a stamp, "which rows predate the STAT-01 fix" is a field test instead of an
archaeology project.

THE BOUNDARY, AND WHY IT IS DRAWN HERE
--------------------------------------
The digest must answer: *if this set of bytes is identical, is the number
necessarily identical?*  Two boundaries are obviously wrong.

  * **The whole repository.**  Useless.  A typo fix in `README.md` changes the
    digest, so every row's identity churns for reasons that cannot affect any
    number, and the field stops carrying information.
  * **Only the estimator file.**  Unsafe.  `bin/jointstd/stats.py` calls
    `chi2.norm_ppf` for every BCa endpoint; a one-ULP change in `chi2.py` moves
    published endpoints while `stats.py` is byte-identical.  The stamp would say
    "same code" about two different numbers, which is worse than no stamp.

So the boundary is the **computational closure**: every file on the path from
the published inputs to the published number, enumerated by role, and nothing
else.  For the joint-standard derivation that is the estimator, its numerical
support, the protocol stamper, the enrichment layer that fixes B, the seed and
the rounding -- and the coverage simulator, because `coverage_measured` is a
published number and that is the code that produced it.  It is NOT
`seed_registry.py` (it assembles rows and changes whenever an unrelated row is
added), NOT the validator, NOT the renderer, NOT docs.

The boundary errs deliberately toward **over-sensitivity**.  `joint_enrich.py`
carries a `SERIES` table, so adding an unrelated measurement series changes the
id of rows whose numbers did not move.  That is the safe direction: a changed id
costs a reader one diff of `code_digests`, which name their roles precisely so
the diff is legible, while a missed change costs them a wrong comparison.  The
guarantee is one-way and is stated that way everywhere:

    equal harness_id  =>  identical code
    differing id      =>  look at code_digests; the number may or may not move

WHAT IS *NOT* IN THE ID, AND WHY
--------------------------------
`repository.commit` is recorded but does NOT enter `harness_id`.  A commit sha
changes on a docs edit, which is exactly the churn the boundary exists to avoid,
and a commit cannot be recorded by the change that introduces it -- so the
commit is a human pointer and the digests are the identity.  When a row is
produced by a working tree that became the commit introducing it, that is stated
as `commit_role: "parent"` with `dirty: true` rather than back-dated.

`tool_versions` DOES enter the id.  This project has already been bitten by an
interpreter difference moving a published number: CPython 3.12 switched builtin
`sum()` to Neumaier summation and the same data reduced by 3.9 and 3.12 differed
in the last ULP.  An interpreter is part of the estimator.

Dependency-free, stock python3.9, no network.  Importable by the validator, by
`seed_registry.py` and by `registry_add.py`.

    `alias_root` exists because this registry lives in TWO shapes.  In the suite
    repo the tools are at `registry/tools/`; in the published dataset repo --
    the one CONTRIBUTING §1 tells a contributor to clone -- the SAME files are at
    `tools/`, with no `registry/` above them.  Resolving only against
    `repo_root` therefore raised IOError out of `registry_validate.py
    --submission`, which is the single command the contributor path documents,
    so every outside submission check died on a stack trace instead of printing
    ACCEPTED or a named failure.

    The RECORDED `path` stays the suite-relative one in both shapes, and that is
    the point: `harness_id` is a function of the code, not of where somebody
    cloned it.  Only the place the bytes are read from changes.
