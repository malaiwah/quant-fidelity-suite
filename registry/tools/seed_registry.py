#     own config.json, scope="glm53_routed_experts_only",

#     quantization/recipe.json, tensor_policy="uniform-routed-experts",
#     nonrouted_policy="native".
#   * Its materialization-receipt.json (self-seal 092be1ff..., recomputed)
#     states native_tensor_count 1618, packed_tensor_count 148608,
#     routed_choice_count 37152, nonrouted_native_exact true -- i.e. 43 layers
#     x 288 experts x 3 projections of payloads and NOTHING else, with all
#     1,618 non-routed tensors byte-exact official.  Its
#     model.safetensors.index.json carries {trellis,suh,svh,mcg} objects under
#     `.mlp.experts.<n>.` names only; lm_head.weight is a plain BF16
#     [154880, 4096] tensor.
#   * Our own K6/K8 checkpoints have the identical census, recorded in
#     engines/K8-ANOMALY.json test_6_scope: native_tensor_count 1618,
#     output_tensor_count 150226, routed_choice_count 37152,
#     packed_tensor_count 148608, nonrouted_native_exact true.
#
# The old digest mattered: it made these rows look scope-comparable with the

# range, retained_dtype is `source_precision`, and a name census of the
# 583,090-entry index closes on it exactly (580,608 routed payload tensors, and
# a non-routed set that bijects the official release's 1,618 names).  The Q4
# record used to say `unknown` for embed_tokens / attn.qkv / attn.o / lm_head;
# that was a gap in this registry's reading, not in the release's publishing.

# P1-06 (peer review 2026-08-31). The producer behind every row in this section --
# tools/fidelity.py's replay comparator -- computed logits, normalizers,
# probabilities and the VOCABULARY SUM in float32 and cast the finished sum to
# float64, while its receipts (and these rows) declared float64 accumulation. On
# near-equal 50k-vocab distributions that reduction returns negative per-token
# "KL" at the 1e-6 scale where the true float64 value is ~1e-8. The 37 rows are
# relabeled accumulation_dtype=float32_reduce_legacy: the measured values are
# unchanged and the receipts untouched, but the label now tells the truth, and
# because accumulation_dtype is one of the seven comparability-key fields the
# relabel moves them into their own comparability groups -- rankable against each
# other (same reducer), never against a true-float64 row. The reducer itself was
# fixed the same day (bin/selftest_fidelity_reducer.py holds the known answers);
# rows produced by the FIXED code declare float64 honestly.

# M1: Qwen3.8-27B same-lane root capture (hf-transformers lane, RTX PRO 6000)
#
# The 37 Qwen3.8-27B rows above are scored against a vLLM-captured teacher, so
# each carries an unmeasured cross-stack term and its excess over control is
# inferred by subtraction. The rows below are scored against a teacher captured
# by the SAME engine on the SAME lane as the candidates, so the floor is 0.0 by
# construction -- MEASURED, not assumed -- and a candidate's raw KLD IS its
# excess over control, with nothing subtracted.
#
# They are NOT rankable against the 37 older rows. The comparability key binds
# the reference and the references differ. The panel is deliberately the SAME
# one, so the two groups differ by the LANE ALONE, which makes the difference
# interpretable without making it comparable.

# The computational closure for a number this campaign PRODUCED. Unlike every
# row above, metric.value here was computed by code this repository ships, at a
# commit we can name; the bytes that ran were verified byte-identical to that
# commit's blobs ON the machine that ran them, so these rows carry a RECORDED
# harness covering metric.value rather than the grandfather clause.
#
# The digests are transcribed from that verification rather than re-read from
# today's checkout ON PURPOSE: `k6/tools/hf_capture.py` has since changed on
# main, and re-digesting it now would stamp these rows with the identity of code
# that did not produce them -- exactly the failure harness_id.py exists to
# prevent. Anyone can re-derive them: `git show <pin>:<path> | sha256sum`.
# The paths below keep their 2026-08 spelling on purpose. k6_kld_report.py was
# renamed kld_report.py (and k6_student_capture.py -> student_capture.py) on
# 2026-08-31; `harness_id` is a sha256 over {boundary, [{role, PATH, sha256}],
# tool_versions}, so the path is INSIDE the hash. Rewriting it here would give
# these rows the identity of a file whose bytes are not the ones that ran --
# the exact failure harness_id.py exists to prevent -- and would change
# published harness ids. bin/selftest_naming_sweep.py freezes them.

#
# bin/fidelity/dscompare.py::_decode_gate decides a comparison's class from what
# the CANDIDATE's capture had to do to the stored weights: a trellis
# reconstruction, or a declared activation-quantization scheme a weights-only
# capture did not apply, makes the number advisory. 3eee3f0 generalised the
# activation half of that rule from "fp8-block-dequant + dynamic" to ANY
# declared scheme -- which is what NVFP4's static input scales are.
#
# So the sealed `comparability.class` of a receipt is only as good as the
# comparator that sealed it, and three receipts of the SAME decode disagree
# across that commit. The class this seed files is therefore DERIVED here from
# the decode method and the declared scheme, both read from committed evidence,
# and the sealed field is cross-checked: a receipt produced by code that already
# carried the rule must agree, or the seed refuses.

#    suite's own layer-outer streaming engine on brandonmusic's final25 token
#    panel, and wrldsuksgo2mars' K3 scored against that capture.
#
# Registry slug: `glm53-hf`. The 13 older Flash rows on panel--glm53.brandonmusic
# .final25 were scored against brandonmusic's stored fp32 teacher logits
# (reference--brandonmusic.glm53-bf16-fp32-logits.final25), a different lane
# with an inferred 0.011506 floor. This root is a NEW reference and therefore a
# NEW comparability group beside them: the comparability key binds the
# reference, so nothing here upgrades or re-ranks an older row, and the two
# groups are never tabled together (bin/registry-view shows them apart).
#
# Same panel, same panel row: the transported panel directory carries
# brandonmusic's panel.json byte for byte (no panel_id inside it), so the
# sealed datasets name it `panel-artifact-sha256:<sha256 of panel.json>` =
# 6bafe3283c54..., which IS panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25's
# identity.panel_token_sha256. Same token ids, same panel record.
#
# Every number below is READ from a committed receipt in
# registry/protocol/glm53-hf/ at seed time; nothing is transcribed by hand.

# 10. GLM-5.2, same lane, its OWN root (registry slug `glm-5.2`).
#
# A NEW FAMILY, not an extension of the GLM-5.3 one. The panel is literally the
# same object -- panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1, same token ids, same
# suite_token_hash_sha256, and the 5.2 captures bind the identical tokenizer.json
# and tokenizer_config.json by digest -- so the panel record is SHARED and its
# model_scope grows. Everything downstream of the panel is new: these rows are
# scored against a fresh BF16 capture of zai-org/GLM-5.2, which is a DIFFERENT
# teacher, so the reference record is new and the comparability key is new.
#
# NOT AN UPGRADE, and the receipts say how far from it. The two roots were
# compared against each other on this very panel, both directions:
# KL(5.2 root || 5.3 root) = 0.1941 nats and KL(5.3 root || 5.2 root) = 0.1960,
# top-1 agreement 0.8767. That is two orders of magnitude above the differences
# between the quantization rows being ranked inside either family, which is the
# quantitative reason a 5.2 root does not "upgrade" a row measured against the
# 5.3 root (or against brandonmusic's Flash teacher logits): it is not a better
# measurement of the same thing, it is a measurement of a different thing.

# WHY THE LINEAGE RECEIPTS ARE NOT ROWS.
#
# A measurement row in this registry is the fidelity of ONE artifact of ONE
# model against that model's reference. These two receipts are root-vs-root:
# the candidate side is another model's unquantized base. Filing them as rows
# would break in three independent ways, and only the first is cosmetic:
#
#  1. REF-003 forces model_ref = artifacts[artifact_ref].model_ref, so the
#     forward direction would be a `glm-5.3` row whose reference is the 5.2
#     root -- legal only with a cross_model_reference disclosure ON THE
#     REFERENCE, which would then sit on a record that also backs three
#     ordinary 5.2 quantization rows and weaken what it says about them.
#  2. The receipts' own comparability keys are the FAMILY keys
#     (cmp--e493aa0720acdd18 forward, cmp--3b19974d0dc2c657 reverse), so as
#     rows they would land in exactly the groups the quantization rows rank in,
#     and 0.194 nats of MODEL difference would be tabled beside 0.025 nats of
#     FP8 quantization error as if the two were commensurable. BIAS-005 labels
#     a floor row by `artifact_ref == the reference's artifact_ref`; that test
#     does not fire here, so the renderer would rank them.
#  3. Giving them a key of their own would mean minting a panel or reference
#     record that no receipt names, i.e. inventing an identity to hold a number.
#
# So they are cited: by sha256, on the reference record and on every 5.2 row,
# as the measured distance between the two teachers. That is the form this
# registry already uses for evidence that is not a quantization measurement.
