"""The STAT-01 / STAT-17 reseed, tested against the real 42 cells.

The validator selftest (`registry_selftest.py`) proves the registry REFUSES a
by_domain block that shares a seed, omits its measured coverage or publishes a
negative lower bound.  This proves the arithmetic underneath it: that the new
interval is what it says, that the OLD numbers are still regenerable so the
change is attributable rather than merely different, and that the coverage
figures the rows publish are the ones the committed simulation produced.

Every case here fails against the pre-2026-08-30 code.  T1/T2 fail because
`derive_seed` does not exist and every domain drew the same stream; T3 fails
because `delta_t_log` does not exist; T4 fails because `domain_table` had no
`interval` parameter to ask for the old procedure by name; T6/T7 fail because
`coverage_measured` was never computed for anything.  T8 fails against the
pre-2026-09-05 code because `joint_enrich` read only the Flash per-window files
and left every GLM-5.3 row at `uncertainty.method: none`.

Needs numpy, for the same reason `make reseed` does: the resample stream must be
PCG64.  Run with `make stat-selftest`.
