"""Shared primitives for the quant-fidelity-registry tools.

Everything in this module is pure, deterministic and OFFLINE. No module in this
package may import a networking library; tools/registry_validate.py --offline-selftest
asserts that over the whole transitive import graph.

The two derived values that the registry's comparability guarantee rests on --
comparability.key and scope_digest -- are computed HERE and nowhere else, so
registry_add.py (which writes them) and registry_validate.py (which recomputes
and rejects mismatches) can never drift apart.
