"""The comparability PREDICATE: what an equal key does NOT certify, made machine-readable.

The seven-field ``comparability.key`` is a NECESSARY partition key: rows under
different keys are never comparable, full stop. It was never a SUFFICIENT
certificate, and this registry's own data is the proof:

  * the key carries no measurement LANE, and group ``cmp--202b717f3219c414``
    holds one artifact measured on two lanes, differing in the fourth decimal;
  * the key carries no candidate PIPELINE, and the same checkpoint/panel/teacher
    measured through two pipelines has differed by ~24% (0.030480 vs 0.024555);
  * the key carries no HARDWARE class, and an A100-vs-H200 term of 2.97e-4 nats
    is ~13x the gap this registry publishes between two 4-bit quantizers
    (docs/ARCHITECTURE-DETERMINISM.md);
  * the key carries no artifact SCOPE, and a routed-experts-only quant and a
    full-forward GGUF at "the same" bpw are different interventions
    (docs/GGUF-MEASUREMENT.md).

This module computes, per comparability group, the secondary-dimension check
that must ALSO pass before rows are ranked as like-for-like:

  comparable = "true"     every secondary dimension is recorded and homogeneous
                          across the group's live members;
  comparable = "false"    a RECORDED secondary dimension differs -- ranking
                          across it attributes a lane/pipeline/hardware/scope
                          effect to quantization quality;
  comparable = "unknown"  nothing recorded differs, but at least one dimension
                          is unrecorded for at least one member, so homogeneity
                          cannot be certified.

The key deliberately stays UNVERSIONED AND UNCHANGED: rehashing it would regroup
every published row and orphan every key third parties have already cited. The
predicate is additive metadata beside the key, not a new key.

Computed here and nowhere else, so tools/registry_render.py (which writes it
into index.json) and tools/registry_validate.py (which recomputes it and rejects
a hand-edited index, CMP-007) can never drift apart.

Stdlib only, offline, python 3.8+.
