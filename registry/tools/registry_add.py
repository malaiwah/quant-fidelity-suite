"""Turn a sealed receipt into a conformant measurement row -- refusing to invent provenance.

Dispatch is on the receipt's own declared `schema` string, exact match. An unknown
receipt family is an error naming the observed string, never a guess at its shape.
Every field the row carries is either READ from the receipt (and recorded in
`field_provenance` with a JSON Pointer into it), or SUPPLIED by an explicit flag.
Nothing is defaulted, inferred or averaged into existence. Booleans and aggregates
that the receipt asserts are RECOMPUTED from the underlying arrays, and a
disagreement is an error rather than a warning.

Offline by construction: no networking module is imported anywhere in this module's
graph, and `--offline-selftest` proves it. `--*-url` flags record strings; nothing is
ever fetched.

this tool's own logic):

  3 unrecognized receipt `schema` string
  4 required provenance missing and no flag supplied
  5 receipt internally inconsistent (a recomputation disagreed with the receipt)
  6 provenance void: a flag asserts something the receipt contradicts, with no --disclosure
  7 identity clash: --panel / --reference / --artifact does not match the receipt's, or

# The single-GPU streaming lane. Three summary families and one verdict.
#
# The K6 family's own name carries `-stream-`: that string is written by
# tools/stream_score.py's aggregator and by nothing else, so dispatching on it IS
# a statement about which lane produced the file. The K8 and native-BF16 families'
# names carry no such marker -- K8's `profile` reads "k8-tp4" and the native-BF16
# receipt's own `profile` reads "native-bf16-stream", but this tool dispatches lane
# identity off the `schema` string alone, never off a content field a receipt could
# spell differently -- so neither receipt says which lane it came from and the lane
# has to be supplied by --lane. The difference is recorded per-family in
# LANE_STATED_BY_SCHEMA rather than sniffed out of strings at read time.
#
# The native-BF16 family is shaped exactly like the other two (measured_mean_kld /
# run_means / distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256 / cold_run_count / bitwise_deterministic)
# but its artifact is not a quant at all: it is the reference's OWN unquantized
# weights, scored through this same streaming harness (tools/stream_score.py
# --source native). That makes a row built from it the streaming lane's measurement
# floor -- see build_row's is_floor test and BIAS-004/005/006.
#
# The MLX family is the same shape again, produced by the same aggregator from a
# stream_score.py --source mlx capture.  Two things make it different from every
# other family here and both end up on the row as disclosures rather than as
# assumptions: its artifact is an UNSEALED third-party conversion (no contract,
# no payload digests -- the pins are the repo revision and the config/index
# sha256), and its quantization SCOPE reaches past the routed experts into dense
# MLPs, shared experts and attention projections, so the row must not be read as
# "experts quantized, everything else official".  The receipt states the measured
# scope policy; this tool copies it onto the row verbatim.
# The GGUF family is the same shape again, produced by the same aggregator
# (k6_kld_report.py --profile gguf) over stream_score.py --source gguf. What
# makes it different from every other row in this lane is SCOPE: a community
# llama.cpp GGUF quantizes the embeddings, the attention/KDA/DSA path and
# lm_head as well as the routed experts, and the measured forward therefore runs
# the artifact's own non-routed weights rather than the reference's. That is not
# a caveat this tool may infer -- the summary carries a scope_policy block read
# from the artifact's own tensor table, and the adapter below turns it into a
# disclosure on the row so a reader never compares a whole-model quant against a
# routed-experts-only one without being told.

# make it different from every other family here and both are disclosed on the
# row rather than left to a reader: the artifact is SOMEONE ELSE'S and carries no
# encoder-side seal, and its measured scope is weights-only, so any activation
# quantization the artifact declares or ships scales for is NOT in the number.
# Those come out of the summary's own scope_policy / activations / seal_disclosure
# blocks, which stream_score copies verbatim from the sealed capture receipt --
# see _apply_nvfp4_disclosure, which REQUIRES them rather than tolerating a
# summary that dropped them.
# The three community-quant weight-decode families.  Each schema string names
# its FORMAT, so a registry row can never be read as if it came from another

    """F5: the single-GPU streaming lane -- a packed-KLD summary, optionally with its verdict.

    Shape-wise this is the Dione summary's twin (measured_mean_kld / run_means /
    distinct_tokenwise_kld_sha256 / bitwise_deterministic / cold_run_count), and it is
    recomputed the same way: the asserted mean is re-derived from run_means and the
    asserted `bitwise_deterministic` flag is re-derived from the per-run means and the
    distinct tokenwise digests. The flag is never trusted; a disagreement is exit 5.

    What this family does NOT state, and therefore what this adapter refuses to invent:

      * the KL direction and the accumulation dtype -- neither appears anywhere in the
        file, so --direction and --accumulation must supply them;
      * how many positions and contexts were scored -- the summary is a scalar, so
        --scored-positions and --contexts must supply them, unless a verdict receipt
        is also given, in which case the context count is READ from its per-window
        array and the array's mean is checked against the summary's scalar;
      * which lane produced it, for the K8 and native-BF16 families (see
        LANE_STATED_BY_SCHEMA).

    When the verdict IS supplied it is not carried along unread. Every number it
    asserts about the bridge to the sealed lane -- the per-window deltas, their
    maximum, the mean delta -- is recomputed from its own per_window array, and the
    verdict is required to agree with the summary about the value, the per-run means
    and the tokenwise digests. That is what makes the bias block on the resulting row
    a measurement rather than a claim.
