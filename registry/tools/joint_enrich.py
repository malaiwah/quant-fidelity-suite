"""Joint-standard enrichment of the seeded measurement rows.

WHAT THIS ADDS, and why each piece is here.

Before 2026-08-29 every measurement row in this registry carried
``uncertainty: {"method": "none"}`` -- a point estimate with no interval.
brandonmusic's proposed community standard asks for a window-clustered interval,
a per-domain table, run-to-run spread combined in quadrature, and a protocol
hash stamped into the output.  All of that is recoverable from data we already
published, with no GPU: our receipts carry per-window means, every window is
exactly 2047 scored positions, and the panel's domain assignment is public.

So this module, from ``registry/protocol/per-window/*.json``:

  * computes the window-block bootstrap (percentile + BCa, B=5000, seed
    20260829) and the cluster-robust SE, and writes them into ``uncertainty``;
  * computes ``sigma_run`` from the row's OWN ``determinism.run_means`` -- never
    from a hardcoded constant -- and combines it with the clustered SE in
    quadrature;
  * writes the per-domain table into ``by_domain``;
  * stamps the frozen protocol's two hashes into ``protocol``;
  * names the scope (``panel25``) and records the calibration-overlap scan that
    defines the alternative scope;
  * emits a SECOND row per series on the calibration-clean ``clean17`` scope.

The clean17 rows are not a correction and do not supersede anything.  They are
the same measurement read over a different, smaller window set, and they exist
because brandonmusic's 13-gram scan showed the sealed panel is not
calibration-clean.  The two scopes disagree in DIRECTION between contributors --
every malaiwah row falls 12.6-16.2% on the clean scope while his own 4bpw row
rises 1.6% -- so neither scope can stand in for the other and both are published.
The two Flash rows that carry no per-window array (the BF16 streaming floor and
the Dione Q4) are named in NOT_RECOMPUTABLE so the omission is visible.

GLM-5.3 (the 2026-09 family, slug ``glm-5.3``, panel corpus5x5-v1) is a second
SOURCE of the same window means: its comparison receipts under
``registry/protocol/glm-5.3/`` carry ``per_context`` -- one entry per window
with the window's mean and its scored-position count.  Those rows get the
interval and nothing else.  The frozen protocol, the calibration-overlap scan,
the clean17 scope and the coverage simulation are all objects of the Flash
panel25 and would be a borrowed claim on any other panel, so a series declares
``panel=False`` and the enrichment refuses to write any of them.  No coverage
simulation exists for corpus5x5-v1; the note says so and calls the level
nominal.

No number here is invented: every value is a deterministic function of
per-window means this registry already publishes, and ``make check`` re-derives
all of it from those files.

# The clean17 scope is a DIFFERENT PANEL, not a footnote on the same one.
#
# The registry's CMP-003 invariant caught this the moment the clean-scope rows
# were first written under the parent panel's comparability key: two rows that
# score a different number of positions must not sit in one comparison group.
# That is the correct answer, and the registry already had a precedent for it
# (panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final-0000). So the clean scope gets its own
# derived panel record and its own derived reference record, which gives it its
# own comparability key and makes a clean17-vs-panel25 table structurally
# impossible rather than merely discouraged.
