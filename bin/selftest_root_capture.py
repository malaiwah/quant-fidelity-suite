"""`--role root` -- capturing the thing every other measurement is a distance from.

The measure path answers "how far is this quant from the reference?". A root
capture answers nothing: it PRODUCES the reference side, sealed and
publishable, so that later measurements read it instead of re-deriving it. It
has no candidate, no divergence and no engine profile, and the one thing it
must never do is capture a quantized checkpoint and call it a floor.

Offline: the release's config is injected, so this proves the DECISIONS, not
the network.
