"""Check documented CLI syntax and authored budget arithmetic, not execution.

Parsing against argparse establishes accepted flags and required arguments. It
does not prove download availability, successful capture, paid admission or parity.

The defect this guards against (contributor-experience review, 2026-08-31):
the local recipe was **not executable as written**. It omitted `--execute`
(measure-local is plan-only by default and exits 3 on a clean plan), and said
nothing about measure-local being unable to fetch the artifact, the teacher or
the pipeline — so a stranger pasted it, got a refusal, and could not tell
whether they had broken something. Docs had also drifted from argparse before
(the 2026-08 flag reconciliation found five documented flags that did not
exist), so this test PROBES the CLI rather than trusting the prose, the same
rule the engine pinning uses.

The second defect (cloud usability review, 2026-09-05, S1-2): four copies of
the root recipe shipped `--max-cost 40 --max-runtime 3h30m` after the bound in
`bin/engines.json` had been re-authored to 26925 s, so the copy/paste recipe
refused on its own numbers twice before showing a plan. R7 recomputes the
bound with the controller's own arithmetic (`measure_cloud._root_workload_bound`)
for every documented root recipe whose target has a timing row, and R8 holds
`--max-cost` at or above the all-in figure the same documents state.

Rungs:
  R1  every `bin/<tool>` command in a ```bash fence of README's recipe
      sections, docs/THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md, docs/CLOUD-RECIPES.md and
      registry/CONTRIBUTING.md parses against that tool's real argparse
      parser (placeholders substituted; unknown flags or missing required
      args fail the rung).
  R2  wrapper commands with no importable parser (registry-submit) exist and
      are executable, and their delegate script exists.
  Prose is reviewed as documentation, not certified by substring assertions.
  R6  a malformed decimal is an argparse refusal, not a traceback.
  R7  every documented `measure-cloud --role root` recipe with a 40-hex
      revision whose target has an authored timing row carries
      `--max-runtime` >= the controller's workload bound (fresh root, two
      captures, container-disk layout).
  R8  the same recipes carry `--max-cost` >= the all-in maximum the cloud
      documents state for that target, and the documents agree on it.
