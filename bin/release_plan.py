"""What a release build would tag, build and push -- decided here, not in YAML.

    release_plan.py --event release --ref refs/tags/v0.3.1 --sha <40-hex>
    release_plan.py --event workflow_dispatch --sha <40-hex> --publish false

Prints a JSON plan and, with --github-output, the `name=value` lines the
workflow consumes.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT WORKFLOW EXPRESSIONS.  A GitHub Actions expression is
untestable anywhere except GitHub: you find out it was wrong by pushing a tag
and reading a red run. This repository's whole discipline is that a rule which
decides what gets published is exercised offline first -- so the tag rule, the
platform list and the publish gate live in a script the workflow calls, and
`bin/selftest_container.py` drives that script with known inputs and known
answers. The workflow becomes plumbing: checkout, qemu, buildx, call this,
build what it said.

THE PUBLISH GATE IS DEFAULT-OFF, ON PURPOSE.  Pushing an image to a registry
is a maintainer's decision, not a side effect of landing a workflow file.
`--publish` comes from a repository VARIABLE (`vars.PUBLISH_CONTAINER`), so the
files can be reviewed and merged with the registry step inert, and enabling it
later is one switch rather than one commit. Every plan says, in words, whether
it would push and why not.
Manual dispatch additionally requires --manual-publish=true, supplied by the
workflow's default-false publish input. Releases need only the repository gate.

Stdlib only, python3.9-clean.
