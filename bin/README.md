# `bin/` — the recipes

`measure`, `measure-cloud` and `measure-local` are the user-facing product: a
stranger with a quant and a GPU should be able to paste one line and get a
sealed, submittable number — or the honest answer that the number already
exists, or a refusal that names its arithmetic. `registry-view` browses the
public registry from the CLI; `registry-submit` checks a sealed receipt the
way the registry will, before it is sent anywhere.

## Why here and not in `engines/tools/`

`engines/tools/` holds the ENGINES — checkpoint readers and capture/scoring
implementations. Support is architecture-, surface- and schedule-specific:
fixture/truncated runs of MiniMax-M3 or DeepSeek V4 do not prove every engine
can run those full models. An engine is pointed at a checkpoint; the runners
here are the commands a contributor invokes. Putting them
at the top level alongside `registry/` is what makes the pair read as a product
rather than as internal tooling.

The measurement **engines** stay where they are. `bin/` orchestrates; it does
not measure. That split is enforced by `engines.json`.

## The one-command flow (`bin/measure`)

```bash
bin/measure <hf-url-or-repo>[@rev][/subpath] [--plan-only] [--force] [--path SUB]
```

Nine steps, one status line each; every refusal states its remedy, exit codes
`0` (already-measured report OR completed measurement/preview), `3` (refusal),
`4` (no data source), never a stack trace:

1. **parse** the target (URL, `org/name`, `@rev`, `/tree/rev`, trailing
   subpath → `--path` hint for multi-artifact repos);
2. **load the registry** (public HF dataset first, local clone fallback,
   snapshot printed);
3. **resolve the revision** (default: the live head — what a download today
   fetches; HF's 401-for-nonexistent is reported as the three-way it is:
   gone/private/gated are indistinguishable unauthenticated);
4. **already measured?** → print the rows + receipt links and exit 0
   (`--force` to measure anyway; revision drift needs `--force` or
   `--accept-measured-revision`);
5. **lineage**: walk `base_model` tags to a root the registry knows (both zai
   roots — FP8 and BF16 — land on the same model);
6. **panel + teacher**: the pair prior measurements of that model used, with
   the alternatives and their `--panel/--teacher` overrides printed;
7. **surface**: a target unsupported by the selected route is refused HERE,
   for $0.00; a reader elsewhere in the tree does not imply lane admission;
8. **lane**: `local-mps` on Apple Silicon, `local-cuda-budget` otherwise;
   `--lane streaming` is redirected to `measure-cloud` (bin/measure never
   rents);
9. **hand off** to `measure-local --execute` (or `--estimate-only` with
   `--plan-only`), whose preflight verifies FIDELITY_PYTHON, torch,
   transformers>=5.16, quant_pipeline, the teacher tree and disk FIRST and
   refuses with *all* missing prerequisites and their remedies at once.

## Registry lookup & viewer (`bin/registry-view`)

```bash
bin/registry-view check  zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash          # STALE by default: live head vs pinned rev
bin/registry-view rows   --model glm --lane streaming   # filtered tables
bin/registry-view lineage 0xSero/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-Q4  # walk + panel/teacher pick
```

Rendering rules (reproduced from `registry/tools/registry_render.py`, the
normative reference): rows are grouped by the **recomputed** comparability key
— never the stored block — one table per key; named-lane rows are tabled
apart from no-declared-lane rows (None means "no declared lane", NOT
"sealed"); equal keys and lane labels alone do not authorize ranking —
`pair_predicate` must permit the pair. A filter may HIDE groups but never
MERGE them; single-row groups say "nothing to rank against"; subset
panels carry their caveat; the footer names the snapshot that answered
(dataset commit sha or local git HEAD). `check` tiers artifacts EXACT /
UNPINNED / STALE / PINNED-UNVERIFIED and quotes the `revision_unpinned`
disclosure verbatim. Data sources: `--registry auto|hf|local[:PATH]` — `check`
prefers the published mirror, `rows`/`lineage` prefer the offline clone.

## Guarded registry publication (`bin/registry-publish`)

`registry-submit` validates a receipt locally; it never publishes. The owner-only
publisher targets **only** the public HF dataset
`malaiwah/quant-fidelity-registry`. It never rents, creates a repository, merges,
deletes remote files, regenerates scientific values or rewrites the audit.

```bash
# Anonymous read-only preflight; select an existing interpreter with NumPy.
bin/registry-publish --python "$FIDELITY_PYTHON" --plan /tmp/registry-plan.json
# Only after reviewing that complete plan and approving this HF destination:
bin/registry-publish --python "$FIDELITY_PYTHON" --expected-parent <40-hex-sha> \
    --approval <reviewed.json> --approval-sha256 <reviewed-file-sha256> \
    --execute --token-file <owned-0600-file> --plan /tmp/registry-published.json
```

Without `--execute`, even a supplied token file is **not read**. Reads use stock
Python and anonymous pinned public URLs; only execution lazily imports
`huggingface_hub`. Ambient tokens, login caches and alternate HF endpoints are not
publication credentials. The explicit file must be owned by the current user,
regular, nonsymlinked and exactly mode 0600. Tokens never enter command arguments,
plans or upload payloads.

The authored inventory is Git's tracked/staged `registry/` tree mapped to dataset
root, not a directory mirror. Stage newly recovered public evidence first;
untracked sources and missing authored files refuse. Caches, credentials and
symlinks refuse rather than disappearing silently. All public-only rows and
source/evidence files must be recovered; the only explicitly retained remote-only
member is Hub transport metadata `.gitattributes`. Existing `protocol/` and
`receipts/` bytes cannot be rewritten, even by an approval.

Preflight runs the canonical strict validator (`--json --jsonschema-lib mini`),
`render-check`, `joint` and `reseed-check`, using `--python` (default
`FIDELITY_PYTHON`, otherwise the running interpreter). All checks remain offline;
the publisher owns networking. Validation errors or stale rendered/reseeded data
block publication. This is snapshot publication, **not warning-free software
release certification**: `make -C registry check-release` remains unchanged and
fails on warnings. Warning-only rc=2 requires an explicit approval bound to the
exact audit bytes/count and an exact match of all current warning findings,
dispositions, collection counts and audited file hashes.

The complete JSON plan goes to stdout (diagnostics to stderr). `--plan` also
atomically writes it **outside this checkout**, distinct from the credential and
approval files. It enumerates every publication path/hash/action, collection
additions/deletions, exact existing-row field deltas and every scan finding/refusal.
Equal numeric spellings are a no-op; no epsilon or ULP tolerance authorizes a
scientific change. Every existing-row field change, including identity or
disclosures, requires a reviewed approval with this contract:

- `schema`: `qfs/registry-publication-approval/v1`; `repository`: the canonical
  dataset; `parent_commit`: the freshly resolved immutable parent.
- `collection_sha256`: all six local collection names mapped to exact JSONL byte
  digests; `field_changes`: the exact ordered plan entries
  `{collection, id, path, old, new}`. `path` is a JSON pointer; old/new are
  `{present: true, value: ...}` or `{present: false}` for an absent field.
- `review`: nonempty `reviewer` and `reason`. `--approval-sha256` binds the exact
  reviewed file bytes, so changing even review text requires another review.
- Optional `warning_disposition`: `{audit_sha256, warning_count}`. The audit
  must retain each warning verbatim (`check`, `severity`, `id`, `message`,
  `remedy`) with a rationale/status; a matching count alone is insufficient.
- Optional `scan_exceptions`: exact `{path, sha256, finding_sha256, reason}`
  entries copied from inspected false-positive findings. No blanket bypass:
  changed file bytes, additional findings or unused exceptions refuse.

New/modified artifacts are scanned for credential shapes, exact execution-token
bytes and private host paths. Already public path occurrences remain recorded
and byte-preserved; only new occurrences require review. Findings expose line
numbers and hashes, not secret text. Exact execution-token matches cannot be
excepted. Historical receipt preservation is not permission to publish new
private paths.

Execution rechecks HEAD and uses one `parent_commit` compare-and-swap commit.
Concurrent remote changes require a fresh plan/review, never a forced retry.
The returned immutable commit's entire file inventory and blob/LFS digests must
match the planned bytes, and every changed file is anonymously downloaded and
compared byte-for-byte. A post-commit verification failure records
`committed_unverified` and the revision to inspect before retrying.
An interrupted/ambiguous commit response records `commit_outcome_unknown` and
`mutation_performed: null`, not an invented claim that nothing was published.
An exact already-converged snapshot creates no commit.

## Preview scoring (`bin/kld-preview`)

Scores capture trees locally. CENSUS mode scores every stored panel position;
the earlier 0.15 ms/position CPU figure is a workload-specific observation,
not a universal reason to dismiss scoring costs. SAMPLED mode
(`--store-positions per-window:<m>`) slices teacher rows at the student's
stored indices and uses a stratified finite-panel estimator with FPC and
position-sampling uncertainty. This uncertainty concerns omitted positions
under the sampling design, not generalization to new source documents.
Heavy tails can undermine nominal z/bootstrap coverage; tail diagnostics do
not calibrate it. Every window must contribute for a panel estimate; window
subsets get per-window diagnostics only. One window can describe itself,
not establish the full panel or population ranking.

Preview receipts are **structurally unsubmittable on two independent axes**:
(1) bin-side — schema contains `-preview.`, headline field is
`preview_panel_mean_estimate` (never `measured_mean_kld`),
`not_submittable: true`, and `fidelity/receipt.build_submission` refuses all
three markers anywhere in its inputs; (2) registry-side — no
`submission_schema` key (the validator's const gate refuses) and no
`registry_add` adapter accepts a `-preview.` schema string (demonstrated
live: exit 3 naming the string). Position sampling is a storage/teacher-
bandwidth knob, not a compute knob: the causal trunk runs every position
regardless.

## Floor-aware stats (`bin/fidelity-stats`)

`attributable` is the historical command name: it reports a **descriptive
native-baseline KL contrast**, quant mean minus a compatible control mean.
It does not identify an additive codec effect. Teacher identity and lane
gates remain mandatory; a negative subtraction is not, by itself, proof
that a measurement is invalid. The old cross-stack subtraction
0.012384 − 0.012712 = −0.000328 illustrates why unlike controls must not
be substituted, not a mathematical law of KL. A zero control requires
the declared repeatability evidence; see [`engines/SAME-LANE-TEACHER.md`](../engines/SAME-LANE-TEACHER.md).

A zero claimed by the legacy scalar-summary format is refused even if a
`zero_floor_evidence` note names a hash kind: no teacher/student tensor operands
are bound there. Use the sealed dataset comparison and qualification route to
establish an actual zero control.

`paired-delta` reports **B − A**. Window t/BCa/sign/Wilcoxon fields are
descriptive diagnostics, not population inference. Both normal reports
need matching teacher and token-panel receipt identities, and declared
token hashes/counts/document and lane identities must agree. Conditional
source-document inference requires explicit consistent per-window
`document_id` provenance on both sides and an independent/exchangeable
document assumption. Its document sign test is primary under that assumption;
the equal-document t interval is illustrative. Missing provenance means
`inference_unit: none`, not guessed window independence. The old n=25 SE/MDE
constants are withdrawn; finite-panel differences are descriptive conditional
on the captured bytes and replay arithmetic.

## Engine pinning

A lane whose engine is not `pinned: true` in `engines.json` **refuses to
plan**. It does not guess flags.

**All five lanes are now pinned**: `sealed-ep8` (against
`engines/tools/student_capture.py`), and `bf16-floor`, `streaming`,
`local-mps`, `local-cuda-budget` (all against `engines/tools/stream_score.py`,
every required flag verified by `bin/measure-local --probe-engines` in the
real file). The 2026-08-29 reconciliation was done by PROBING the CLI (AST
scrape of the argparse declarations), never by reading docs. Planner-only
knobs (`--window-batch`, `--nonrouted-residency`, `--decode-batch-matrices`,
`--prefetch-depth`) are never forwarded to an engine; `--vram-budget` maps to
the engine's `--vram-budget-gb`; `--reduce-order native` is refused at
invocation build (a sealed-lane concept — engine orders are
fp32|sequential|reverse|pairwise|rotate:N). The lanes `measure-local`
executes emit `receipt_class: preview`; the submittable chain is the
streaming lane's (`measure-cloud`) and the dataset route's
(`fidelity-dataset capture --engine hf-transformers` → `compare`, the engine
behind every GLM-5.3 row). Timing stays honest: the local lanes'
`minutes_per_window` is **null** — decode is measured (16–20 ms/matrix MPS)
but the KDA trunk forward is not, and no number is invented (run
`bin/measure-local --fixture fetch` for the fixture-scale datum).

### History: the 2026-08 flag reconciliation

Preserved verbatim, because the guess-nothing rule earned its keep — the
contract that was written for these lanes was wrong in every guessed
spelling. The engine takes `--teacher` not `--panel`, `--source` not
`--surface`, `--vram-budget-gb` not `--vram-budget`, `--slab-experts` not
`--expert-chunk`; `--window-batch`, `--kld-device` and
`--nonrouted-residency` do not exist at all. Fixing the spellings would not
have been enough:

* `--profile` accepts only `k6|k8|k6k8|native-bf16`, and the controller sent
  `k4` for these lanes (now: `profile_map` in `engines.json`, with a refusal
  for unmapped bit-widths).
* **Every source path resolves to a packed root** and requires
  `contract.json`, `inventory.json`, `mtp-adapter-receipt.json` and
  `payload-store/{objects,choices}` — this campaign's own encode output —
  plus a `--bf16` tree, with ONE exception: `--source native --profile
  native-bf16` needs no packed root at all — only the `--bf16` tree, a sealed
  `inventory.json` (`--inventory`) and the panel. That is the BF16-floor lane
  (see `engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`), and it is also the shape a `tr3-published` reader
  would need. `--source dione` raises *"not enabled in this build"*.

*(That last paragraph is history: `tr3-published`, `dione`, `exl3hf` and `gguf`
readers have all landed since. The GGUF one is the odd member of the set -- it
reads a llama.cpp container, whose repo is a shelf of a dozen builds and whose
quantization covers the whole forward rather than the routed experts alone, so
`--path` is required and its rows are not rankable against the others. See
[`docs/GGUF-MEASUREMENT.md`](../docs/GGUF-MEASUREMENT.md).)*

Which lane reads which surface today is deliberately **not** restated here:
the authoritative table is the generated support matrix in
[README → *Before you rent*](../README.md#before-you-rent-what-is-measurable-today),
rendered from `engines.json` by `bin/render_support_matrix.py` and
drift-checked by `bin/selftest_support_matrix.py`. A surface no lane lists is
refused at plan time by the surface check (`engines.json` → `surfaces`), for
$0.00, instead of after the rental — and `bin/measure` says exactly that at
step 7.

## Adding a new engine or surface

1. Add the entrypoint and `required_flags` to `engines.json`.
2. Declare `surfaces` — the artifact kinds it can actually open. This is what
   stops a rental for bytes nothing can read; leaving it empty disables the
   check.
3. `bin/measure-local --probe-engines` until every required flag is found.
4. Only then `pinned: true` with a filled `flag_map`.

## Performance notes (local)

Two engines, two schedules; `measure-local --estimate-only` names the one
that reads your target on its `MEMORY PLAN` line and prices only that one.

**`stream_score.py` (the lanes `measure-local` executes): window-major**
(`--stream-mode window-major`, deliberately: it replays the sealed per-window
`model()` call verbatim). The planner prices it honestly (`window_major_cost`
in `local-plan.json`): decode 16–20 ms/matrix on MPS → ~11 min/pass, ×25
windows with `--decode-cache none` (~4.5 h), vs `--decode-cache disk` = one
decode + 25 re-reads of the 609 GB decoded surface (~42–51 min at the 5–6 GB/s
of Apple internal NVMe — IF 609 GB is free; measure your disk before
assuming). `ram` caches `floor(0.8·budget/14.5 GB)` layers (7 of 42 on 128
GB). `--unpack-device cpu` is a fixed flag of the local-mps lane (the MPS
int64 escape; decode stays bitwise). The scorer takes `--chunk-positions 512`
(selftest-proven) vs the sealed default 16. The planner's `expert_chunk` /
`window_batch` block is this lane's panel-batched **cost model**, priced over
the pinned GLM-5.3-Flash census, and applies to Flash `packed`/`native-bf16`
targets only.

**`hf_capture.py --schedule layer-outer` (the dataset route,
[`docs/LAYER-OUTER.md`](../docs/LAYER-OUTER.md)):** one decoder layer resident,
the checkpoint read once per cold run, windows pushed through sequentially and
never batched. Reads `native-bf16`, `fp8-block` and `exl3hf`. For those
surfaces the planner prints a `LAYER-OUTER CAPTURE PLAN` from the target's
own `config.json` (verified per-layer arithmetic for `glm_moe_dsa`, `qwen3`
and `glm5_next`; an unverified `model_type` is refused by name) and the peaks
the H200 pods measured: GLM-5.3 bf16 and FP8 37.53 GB allocated / 57.08 GB
reserved, the K4 trellis candidate 56.86 GB — so a GLM-5.3-class target is
refused below 64 GB until the chunked expert loader (§8.1) exists, and the
plan says so before any byte is fetched (`BEFORE YOU FETCH`, above 100 GB).
Reached through `bin/fidelity-dataset capture --engine hf-transformers`, not
`measure-local --execute`; README *Recipe 2* has the copy/paste sequence.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `measure`, `measure-cloud`, `measure-local`, `registry-view`, `registry-submit`, `fidelity-stats`, `kld-preview`, `fixture` | one-line wrappers, so the headline paste has no `python3` in it |
| `measure_one.py` | the one-command front-end: resolve, gate, lineage, pick, sniff, hand off |
| `measure_cloud.py` | the paid controller: rents one RunPod pod, measures on it, retrieves the sealed result, destroys the pod. Always enforced: `--max-cost` cap, `--max-runtime` deadline, teardown on every exit path, the installed reaper as backstop. Strict campaign mode (`--campaign-*`, `--runpod-safety-proof`) is opt-in; [`docs/CLOUD-RECIPES.md`](../docs/CLOUD-RECIPES.md) |
| `measure_local.py` | the local runner: registry gate, device discovery, memory solver, micro-benchmark, window-major cost, `--execute` with preflight |
| `registry_view.py` | check / rows / lineage against the local clone or the public dataset |
| `fidelity_stats.py` | floor-aware attributable + paired-window deltas (stdlib statistics) |
| `kld_preview.py` | census/sampled preview scorer (torch; fp64 pinned to CPU) |
| `fixture_fetch.py` | the 0.1B CI fixture, cached by commit |
| `fidelity/census.py` | **the shared, testable core** — model census, VRAM/disk/RAM arithmetic, the memory solver, `window_major_cost`. Pure stdlib. |
| `fidelity/hfmeta.py` | revision pinning, blob sizes, surface sniffing, lineage metadata, panel descriptors |
| `fidelity/registry_client.py` | load local/HF registry, tier matcher, renderer, the front gate |
| `fidelity/lineage.py` | base_model walk → registry model → panel/teacher pick |
| `fidelity/previewstats.py` | stratified estimator + FPC + position bootstrap (pure stdlib, unit-tested) |
| `fidelity/runpodapi.py`, `fidelity/runpodsafety.py`, `fidelity/cloudlease.py`, `fidelity/campaign.py` | RunPod control plane, target identity and drill-proof gates, v2 leases plus the systemd reaper, and the spend ledger (per-run by default, one locked campaign ledger in strict mode) |
| `fidelity/engines.py`, `engines.json` | which scorer each lane invokes, how, and `preflight` |
| `fidelity/receipt.py`, `seal_receipt.py` | build and seal a `submission-receipt.v1` — written as `measurement-receipt.json`, which IS the submission receipt a contributor sends; the preview/teacher denylist |
| `fidelity-doctor` | offline local prerequisite check; paid authorization remains the exact `measure-cloud --dry-run` pre-POST gate |
| `render_support_matrix.py` | renders the README support matrix from `engines.json` (`--write`/`--check`); the end of hand-written support claims |
| `stage_measure.sh`, `watchdog.sh`, `invoke_engine.py` | the on-instance side |
| `BUNDLE.txt` | exactly what gets uploaded to rented hardware |

## Fidelity datasets — capture, verify, compare (`bin/fidelity-dataset`)

Scoring is **three separable steps**, one tool, three modes
([`docs/FIDELITY-DATASET-SPEC.md`](../docs/FIDELITY-DATASET-SPEC.md)):

```
step 1  capture   reference (root) weights + panel  ->  fidelity dataset A
step 2  capture   quantized weights + panel         ->  fidelity dataset B
step 3  compare   A, B  ->  KLD + determinism + a registry-submittable receipt
                  A, A  ->  reproduction confirmation, exactly 0.0
```

A root capture is a public good: produced once, sealed, published, and
thereafter downloaded rather than re-run. Step 2 is publishable **standalone**,
before any comparison exists. Step 3 runs with **neither** set of weights
present.

### Race mode — `--role root --race` (engine-level experiment; refused on the paid path)

**Status 2026-09-05: not runnable on the paid path.** `--race`, `--preview-of`
and `--race-workers` are hidden from `measure-cloud --help` and refused at
three layers before any spend: `measure_cloud.py` `_runpod_forbidden`
(*"--race (not wired on the RunPod path yet; see docs/RACE-MODE.md)"*),
`bin/fidelity/stages.py` `stage_sequence(role="root", race=True)` (*"race/preview
root capture is unsupported by the first safe paid path"*), and
`bin/stage_measure.sh` `race_bootstrap`/`race_capture`. What exists is the
identity separation below (`engines/tools/race_fetch.py`, tested by
`bin/selftest_race_mode.py`) and the design in
[`docs/RACE-MODE.md`](../docs/RACE-MODE.md). The sub-hour path that DOES run
today is `--resume-capture <out-A>/result/dataset --resume-origin-job
<out-A>/result/job.json`: cold run 1 on pod A, cold run 2 plus qualification
on pod B (the published GLM-5.3 root was made this way; a one-run capture is
never publishable as the root). On the container-disk layout the saving race
mode would buy is bounded by `min(fetch, capture)` ≈ 10 min (JOURNAL 2026-09-04:
1.5 TB in 12 min, cold run ~10 min).

When a model lands on the Hub, the quants appear within hours and nobody can
say how good any of them are, because there is no root to measure against.
[`docs/RACE-MODE.md`](../docs/RACE-MODE.md) is the whole story; the short form
of what is built:

* **The fetch stops being a barrier.** `engines/tools/race_fetch.py` reads
  `model.safetensors.index.json`, buckets every shard by the first layer that
  needs it, and downloads in that order while the capture runs. The layer-outer
  loader blocks on layer N's shards only when it is about to load layer N.
  A `race-fetch-report.json` records blocked time. The saved CPU Fruit
  synthetic-panel A/B is evidence for that run, not a guarantee of no slowdown:
  network contention, scheduling and buffering can erase or reverse a saving.
  The head is a **priority-0** file, not a last one — the resident load, the
  vocab/hidden sizes and the capture tap all need it before layer 0.
* **A preview is a different DATASET, not an earlier version of one.**
  `--preview-of FINAL_ID` seals the first cold run under its own `dataset.id`
  with `not_submittable: true` and a blocking `preview_capture` disclosure.
  `reference_id` is a `COMPARABILITY_KEY_FIELDS` member, so updating a published
  root in place would put rows measured against different bytes into ONE
  comparability group; passing the same id for both is refused by name.
* **The generation sanity check runs on EVERY capture**, race or not
  (`engines/tools/generation_probe.py`). `"The capital of France is"` → `" Paris"`,
  as one extra window through the schedule already loading every layer: ~1/N of
  an N-window panel and zero extra weight loading. It can catch a degenerate
  forward even when names/shapes look correct, but one prompt does not prove
  every zero-filled shard is detected or validate full-model semantics.
  A declared `--sanity-expect` and degenerate-distribution failures are refused.

### Before you start — what exists today, and what does not

Published roots and runnable dataset tooling exist, but availability,
registry routing, supported decoding and exact paid admission are separate.
Read the current registry reference records and dry-run before planning GPU time.

| you will want | state today | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| a **root fidelity dataset** to fetch (step 1) | The registry records roots for GLM-5.3, GLM-5.2, GLM-5.3-Flash, Qwen3.8-27B and Fruit; this is no longer a two-root inventory. Examples: [`glm53-fidelity-root-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/glm53-fidelity-root-v1), [`qwen38-27b-fidelity-root-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/qwen38-27b-fidelity-root-v1), [`fruit-fidelity-root-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/malaiwah/fruit-fidelity-root-v1). These are recorded publication identities, not a fresh live availability check. | Read [`registry/data/references.jsonl`](../registry/data/references.jsonl) for the exact immutable URI/revision and panel, then `fidelity-dataset describe hf://<repo>@<revision>`. A small root permits CPU comparison without model weights; creating it still requires capture. |
| a **token panel** (step 1/2) | the hf-transformers engine takes `--panel <dir>`: a committed token-panel tree under `engines/panels/` (`panel.json`, `panel.receipt.json`, `arrays/`). `panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1` (356 KB, the GLM-5.3 family's panel, tokenizer zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16) and the Flash and Fruit panels are committed; `engines/panels/README.md` lists them. The `sealed-lane` engine's `--token-panel` receipt is campaign-internal. (The *runners* `measure-cloud`/`measure-local` take `--panel <hf-dataset>`, a teacher-logit dataset, and the local planner no longer prices its 31.7 GB for the dataset route, which never fetches it.) | For a new family build the panel first: `engines/tools/build_token_panel.py` ([`engines/panels/README.md`](../engines/panels/README.md)). A root capture also needs the panel **binding**: `bin/fidelity-dataset panel-binding --panel engines/panels/<id> --tokenizer-root <checkpoint dir> --out panel.binding.json` writes it and prints the sha256 for `--panel-binding-sha256`. |
| a **cost/time estimate** for a capture | `capture --dry-run` validates inputs, seal and layout for the sealed-lane engine only; the hf-transformers engine has no plan phase and returns exit 4 (`USAGE`) for `--dry-run`. **Neither prints hours, VRAM or dollars.** | Size it with `bin/measure-local --artifact <repo> --panel <dataset> --estimate-only` (the layer-outer capture plan from the target's config.json, the measured H200 peaks, the pre-fetch gate and the exact `fidelity-dataset capture` argv) or `measure-cloud --dry-run`. Measured on H200: GLM-5.3 bf16 root cold capture 1,947 s per run after a 1.51 TB fetch; the K4 candidate 442 s per run after 394 GB. |
| to **submit a comparison to the registry** (step 3) | `compare --emit-submission` requires `--submission-provenance FILE`: artifact identity/scope and existing `panel_ref`/`reference_ref` cannot be inferred from capture bytes alone. It refuses missing provenance and validates the generated submission. | Generate `fidelity-dataset provenance-template --out prov.json`, fill it, then `compare … --emit-submission --submission-provenance prov.json`. Follow [quickstart §6](../docs/THIRD-PARTY-QUICKSTART.md#6-submit-it--one-live-destination) for the submission destination. The paid candidate comparison/qualification handoff is a distinct route; a sealed comparison alone is not automatic registry filing. |
| to **annotate your card** with the result | `fidelity-card annotate --role quant` resolves its numbers from **published registry measurements**, not from your comparison receipt. With no row yet it refuses, and the refusal names the ordering. | The order is: capture → compare → **get the row into the registry** → then annotate. There is no receipt-to-card path, by design: a card cites registry ids, not local receipts. `--role fidelity-dataset` **is** usable — pass `--fidelity-dataset-root DIR` and every value is read out of that dataset's own manifest. `annotate` always self-validates and exits non-zero rather than writing an invalid card. |

**Exit codes:** `0` ok, `2` warnings only, `3` refused, `4` bad usage.

**The refusals worth knowing** (each names its spec rule):

| you will hit | because |
|---|---|
| `head_mismatch` (HEAD-1b) | hidden-form captures declare different `lm_head` content digests. Use `--own-heads` to replay each through its own head. `--disclose-head-substitution` instead changes the estimand, with **unknown** bias direction, blocking/unsubmittable disclosure and `usable_as_floor: false`; it is not a mathematical lower bound. |
| `head_mismatch` (HEAD-4) | a hidden-form dataset with a null head content digest. **No override.** |
| `panel_mismatch` (PANEL-D3) | `scoring_window.score_from` differs. That is a different *panel*, not a comparator flag — which is what makes a llama.cpp-geometry number structurally incomparable rather than silently comparable. There is deliberately no override, so the refusal prints a `remedy:` line saying so. |
| `panel_mismatch` (PANEL-D6) | the two captures declare different tokenizers. `suite_token_hash_sha256` hashes token **ids** — integers — so it cannot see this; two tokenizers can emit the same ids from different text. A field null on either side is *unknown*, not different. |
| `head_substitution_vacuous` (HEAD-1c) | equal hidden content and different heads: shared-head replay would erase a head-only difference and fabricate reproduction. No shared-head override; `--own-heads` is a distinct valid comparison, or capture logits with each artifact's head. `native_head` names head identity policy, not native serving-kernel equivalence. |
| `lane_mismatch` | different lanes. `--allow-cross-lane` proceeds and stamps `usable_as_floor: false`, so **BIAS-006** cannot be laundered downstream. |
| `unlisted_file` / `missing_file` | the tree is not exactly what `checksums.txt` covers. `--allow-partial` narrows this to capture tensors and stamps `covers_full_panel: false`. |
| `bad_vocab_chunk` | `--vocab-chunk` must be a positive integer. A final partial vocabulary block is processed exactly; the safe root qualification profile binds **8192**. |
| `replay_device_mismatch` | `--replay-device` names a device the estimator does not use. Set `--device` to the same value; mismatched-device transfer is not an admitted replay profile, regardless of projected performance. |
| `replay_backend_unavailable` | `--replay-device` other than `numpy` needs torch. The default needs nothing. |
| `bad_replay_dtype` | `--replay-dtype` is `float32` or `float64`. |

`checksums.txt` is `sha256sum --check`-compatible, so a reviewer with none of
our tooling verifies the payload with one coreutils command.

## Card annotation (`bin/fidelity-card`)

Machine-readable fidelity provenance on an HF model or dataset card
([`docs/CARD-ANNOTATION-SPEC.md`](../docs/CARD-ANNOTATION-SPEC.md)): one
conformant `model-index` entry plus one additive `x_fidelity:` block.

```bash
bin/fidelity-card annotate --card README.md --role quant \
    --artifact-id artifact--malaiwah.glm-5.3-flash-tr3-6bpw \
    --base-model zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16 --out README.annotated.md --diff --validate

# a capture publisher's own card (step 2 is publishable standalone)
bin/fidelity-card annotate --card README.md --role fidelity-dataset \
    --fidelity-dataset-root ds-bf16 --fidelity-dataset malaiwah/my-root@main \
    --out README.annotated.md
        # every value is read from that dataset's manifest; nothing is retyped.

bin/fidelity-card validate --card README.md            # three axes
bin/fidelity-card validate --card README.md --offline  # skips the Hub axis, and SAYS so
```

Three validation axes, all must pass: the live Hub `validate-yaml` endpoint
(the same push-time gate), a `huggingface_hub` round-trip that must be
structurally identical, and our own XC-1..XC-5 cross-checks against
`registry/data/measurements.jsonl`.

`annotate` **always validates its own output** against our XC checks and exits
non-zero rather than writing an invalid card; `--validate` adds the Hub and
round-trip axes. It derives `reference_model` / `reference_revision` from the
registry (measurement → reference → artifact → `huggingface.repository`) instead
of asking you to retype them, and **warns by name** for any field it had to
leave null and the flag that would supply it.

`annotate` never rewrites the card **body**, never sets `verified` /
`verifyToken` (HF-controlled), and never invents a head digest — an artifact
with no published head *content* digest gets `replay_permitted: false` and an
explanatory note. Generated cards for K6 and K8 live in
[`docs/cards/`](../docs/cards/); publishing them is a separate, permissioned act.

The paid reaper is RunPod-only and user-systemd-backed. Selftests use stubs or
`reaper --sweep --dry-run`, which destroys nothing. `measure-cloud reaper
--provider runpod --install` needs the owner-only RunPod key and a user
manager with linger; it seals a snapshot of the reaper sources and the timer
runs that snapshot. A checkout that has moved on since is advisory drift, not
an unhealthy reaper: the paid controller warns and proceeds, and re-running
`--install` picks up the newer checkout. Before every create POST the
controller checks that the timer is active, the user manager persists, the
snapshot is intact, the account id and lease path match and the health stamp
is fresh.
