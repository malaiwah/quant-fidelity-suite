"""A second provider must not be able to leak an instance.

Every bug found while porting to RunPod was the same bug: a JarvisLabs
*representation* treated as a universal truth. None of them were about the
measurement, and three of them could have left a billing instance running.

  * machine ids are integers        -> `int(pod_id)` raised AFTER the pod was
                                       created, so the controller died holding
                                       an instance it had never adopted
  * the running state is "Running"  -> RunPod says "RUNNING", so every healthy
                                       poll counted as not-running and the
                                       controller declared a PREEMPTION and
                                       tore down a box mid-bootstrap
  * ids compare as ints in a set    -> the "is it really gone?" check would
                                       report a live instance as destroyed

These are offline: no provider is contacted.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- CONFORMANCE
# A provider you can RENT from is not a provider you can PUBLISH from. The
# controller drives a provider through a fixed surface, and the difference
# between the two is these twelve methods: four that prove the live resource is
# the one requested (and, via attest_live_resource, that it is the DEVICE the
# root was captured on), four that prove nothing of ours is still alive, and
# four that reconcile what it cost against the provider's own clock and billing.
#
# Provider is not a comparability axis -- two A100s in two clouds agree bitwise
# (docs/ARCHITECTURE-DETERMINISM.md), and four GLM-5.3-Flash rows landed on one
# comparability key across three datacenters -- so parity here is legitimate
# science, not convenience. What blocks it is that we cannot yet prove what we
# rented, prove it is gone, or reconcile its cost on any provider but RunPod.
#
# This rung is offline and contacts nothing. docs/PROVIDER-PARITY.md carries the
# per-provider blockers and the definition of done.
