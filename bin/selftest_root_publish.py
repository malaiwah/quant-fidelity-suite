"""ROOT-1: a sealed root gets published, and teardown refuses to eat one.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The controller destroyed a sealed, twice-validated MiniMax-M3 root dataset at
teardown -- $6.59 of GPU time and the only copy of the evidence -- because
nothing published or preserved a root (REVIEW-DEFERRED ROOT-1, fee collected
2026-08-31).

  RP1  remote execution ends at qualification; race and remote publication
       both refuse.
  RP2  legacy teardown holds verified but unpublished root evidence.
  RP3  the explicit legacy override permits that teardown.
  RP4  an already-published legacy root tears down normally.
  RP5  a quant run is unaffected by the legacy root hold.
  RP6  container and safe SSH composition bind intended dataset identity while
       refusing remote publication.
  RP7  RunPod refuses container-native execution and provider-carried HF
       credentials before mutation.
  RP8  malformed or quant-only publication arguments refuse before spend.
  RP9  local publication requires the exact verified two-capture archive,
       qualification, immutable refetch, and fetched-byte binding.
  RP10 SSH controller refuses preview/race paid roots before provider access.
  RP11 container composition refuses the same unsupported path.

Stub provider, no network, $0.00.  Stage-level publication ordering and argv
composition live in bin/selftest_stage_measure.py, which executes the real
script.
