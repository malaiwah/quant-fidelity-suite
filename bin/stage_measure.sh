# deadsnakes python3.12, CUDA 13.0, torch 2.11.0+cu130, transformers 5.16.1,
# the flash-attn wheel, pydantic/formatron/kbnf, and exllamav3 @ c5d9c657 with

# It used to delegate to `engines/stage_campaign.sh setup` (then called stage_k6.sh)
# instead; see bootstrap_measure.sh's header for the two reasons that could
# never work.  These lines said otherwise for weeks while the code below
# already called bootstrap_measure.sh.
#
# Every stage writes a marker into $DONE, so a stage that already finished is a

  # MORE: a GGUF container carries no tokenizer and no vision tower (llama.cpp
  # ships the projector as a separate mmproj file), so gguf_surface's
  # materialized view copies the official config/tokenizer sidecars and reads
  # model.visual.* out of the official shards. On GLM-5.3-Flash all 347 visual
  # tensors live in ONE shard of 120, so this is ~4.2 GB rather than 1.4 TB --
  # computed from the index, never assumed, because a release that spreads the
  # tower over three shards must fetch three.
  #
  # LESS: every measured weight comes from the artifact. No routed expert and
  # no attention projection is read from this tree, which is exactly the scope
  # difference that makes a GGUF row not comparable to a routed-experts-only
  # one.
  #
  # And the inventory: stream_score's identity gate hashes the config.json and
  # index it actually loads against a sealed quant-pipeline.glm-release-
  # inventory.v1. zai publishes no such file, and the surfaces that have one
  # got it from their own materializer. Here it is written over the two
  # OFFICIAL files at the pinned revision, so the gate binds the bytes on this
