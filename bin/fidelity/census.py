"""Model census, fit estimation and the memory solver.

This module is the shared, offline-testable heart of BOTH runners.  Everything
here is pure arithmetic over a `Census` plus a `Device`; no network, no torch,
no GPU.  `selftest_fit.py` exercises it against known-answer cases, which is why
it deliberately has no imports beyond the stdlib.

UNITS.  Every byte count is decimal (GB = 1e9), because that is what Hugging
Face reports and what every published figure in this campaign was quoted in.
`gib()` is provided for the places a human expects nvidia-smi's units.

CENSUS PROVENANCE.  The non-routed footprint is derived by SUBTRACTION:

    nonrouted = total_safetensors_bytes - routed_main - routed_mtp

not by summing a hand-written list of tensor shapes.  Subtraction needs only
one cheap HF API call (`?blobs=true`) and it reproduces the independently
measured 19.34 GB figure (which came from range-fetching all 47 non-routed
shard headers).  A shape-summing derivation of the same quantity came out
~1 GB low because GLM5Next's linear-attention layers and the MTP block do not
have the parameter shapes a generic MoE census assumes.  Subtraction cannot
make that class of mistake: anything it fails to classify as routed lands in
non-routed, which is the conservative direction for a fit estimate.

# its working set is the resident non-layer parameters plus ONE streamed layer
# -- never the whole decoded checkpoint.  Sizing a root against
# `lane_requirement(glm53_flash_census(), "streaming")` therefore quotes a
# constant 63 GB/GPU for every target, because that number is GLM-5.3-Flash's
# OBSERVED window-major peak (47 GB) times a headroom factor and has nothing
# to do with the artifact being captured.
#
# That defect was paid for twice during the GH200 qualification
# (docs/REVIEW-DEFERRED.md ROOT-2): a 10.10 GB Fruit checkpoint was refused on
# every Lambda type under 63 GB -- including a `gpu_1x_a100_sxm4` with capacity
# -- so the control arm had to be rented from another provider, and the same
# arithmetic priced the run at 25 windows when the panel it was given has 16.
#
# The counter-evidence is committed and real: engines/tools/layer-outer-evidence/
# fruit-cuda-l4.json measured that exact checkpoint under `--schedule
# layer-outer` on one L4 at 2.167 GB CUDA allocated (1.471 GB of that resident
# weights), against 10.409 GB for the same capture under window-outer.  The
# refused hardware would have worked with a factor of twenty to spare.
