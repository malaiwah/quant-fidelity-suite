"""Step 3: compare two fidelity datasets.

Two halves, deliberately separable:

  * the GATE LADDER (spec section 10.1) -- eleven ordered gates, each with a
    named refusal id.  Pure stdlib + numpy, no torch, so every refusal is
    testable on a stock py3.9 interpreter with no GPU;
  * the ESTIMATOR (spec section 10.2) -- full vocabulary, fp64 log_softmax.
    When torch is importable this is `kld_report._token_kld`, imported and
    called, never reimplemented, so a number produced here is the same number
    the sealed pipeline produces.  Without torch it falls back to the identical
    fp64 formula in numpy and SAYS SO in the receipt
    (`comparator.estimator_backend`), because a silent backend swap is exactly
    the kind of undeclared difference this whole format exists to stop.

  * the REPLAY (`_replay` / `_TorchReplay`) -- `logits' = hidden @ head.T` for
    a hidden-form capture.  This is where the wall-clock is: M1 measured one
    512-window comparison at 60m19s against a 335s capture of the same panel,
    because the head matmul ran in numpy on the CPU while the GPU already
    holding that head for the estimator sat at 0%.  `--replay-device cuda`
    moves it, and because an fp32 GEMM's accumulation order is the BLAS's
    choice, that is a DIFFERENT NUMBER in the last digits, so it is opt-in and
    named on the receipt (`comparator.replay_backend`).

The A == B short-circuit (SC-1) answers by hash proof without a matmul;
`--force-compute` runs the math anyway and asserts bitwise agreement.

#
# WHY THIS EXISTS.  M1 measured it: one 512-window comparison took 60m19s
# against a 335s capture of the same panel on the same box -- 10.8x the capture
# it consumes -- because `_replay` does the language-model head matmul in numpy
# on the CPU while the GPU, which is ALREADY HOLDING THE HEAD for the fp64 KLD
# step, sits at 0%.  M2 is a 642.7 GB re-capture with several candidates and M3
# is 1.5 TB; at those sizes the capture is a rounding error and the candidate
# comparisons are the entire bill.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT THE DEFAULT.  An fp32 GEMM is not one function.  BLAS
# accumulates in fp32 in an order chosen by the implementation's blocking, so
# `hidden @ head.T` has a different last bit on OpenBLAS, on Accelerate, and on
# cuBLAS.  MEASURED on the real published Qwen3.8 root, 32,752 positions,
# numpy-fp32-on-OpenBLAS against cuBLAS-fp32 with TF32 off: max absolute logit
# delta 3.624e-05 (1.360e-06 relative), and
#
#     KLD(numpy replay || cuda replay) = 5.237e-12 nats mean, 1.791e-10 max,
#     top-1 agreement 1.000000 -- not one argmax flipped.
#
# That is 1.75e-9 relative to the smallest published Qwen3.8 row (FP8,
# 0.002989850396847924) and 2.2e9 times below the streaming lane floor of
# 0.011506, so a row agrees to roughly nine significant figures and differs
# past the tenth.  Small, and NOT ZERO: the published values are 16-digit, so
# they would not reproduce.  A comparison that produces a different value after
# an optimisation is a broken comparison, not a faster one, so the numpy path
# stays the default and the receipt now names which backend ran
# (`comparator.replay_backend`), because a silent replay-backend swap is
# exactly the class of drift this suite exists to make impossible.
#
# WHAT IS BACKEND-INDEPENDENT, AND IT IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST.  The floor.
# A self-compare replays bitwise-equal hidden states through one head on ONE
# backend, so both sides get bitwise-equal logits and the KLD is exactly 0.0
# on any deterministic backend -- the published `tokenwise-kld.npy` digest
# 8be5dcca... included, since it is the digest of 1,048,064 float64 zeros.
# `bin/selftest_replay_device.py` asserts that, on both backends, as a gate.
