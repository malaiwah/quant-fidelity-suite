Called on the instance by `stage_measure.sh measure`.  It exists so the argv is
built from `bin/engines.json` in exactly one place -- the same place the local
runner and the cloud planner read -- rather than being spelled out in a shell
script where a drifted flag would only show up at hour three of a rental.

A lane whose engine is unpinned exits 3 with the contract printed, which is the
same refusal `--dry-run` gives on the caller's laptop.  It should never get this
far: the planner refuses before creating anything.  This is the backstop.

    one line to its stage log -- the argv -- and nothing else until it was
