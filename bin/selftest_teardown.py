"""Offline regression tests for measure_cloud.Teardown.  No rental, no network.

There was no test for `Teardown` at all, which is how CLI-01 and CLI-02(b)
survived: the class that guarantees a rented GPU is destroyed was the one class
nobody exercised.

  CLI-01a  a total API outage must NOT be read as "destroyed"
  CLI-01b  a healthy destroy IS confirmed, from `jl list`, and drops the lease
  CLI-01c  an outage on the CONFIRM only (destroy succeeded) is still unconfirmed
  CLI-01d  an exception escaping a destroy step leaves leaked=True and KEEPS the lease
  CLI-02b  a raise before the steps must not mark the teardown done
  CLI-02c  a second run() after a failed one RETRIES the destroy
  CLI-11   a receipts archive cannot write outside outdir (absolute path,
           `..`, and symlink-plus-write-through)
  CC-07    the packed_root trap is not disarmed by a shard receipt or by a
           file merely named "payload..."
  L52      a resume ATTACHES to a live stage instead of launching a second copy,
           and the liveness probe cannot be answered by its own command text
