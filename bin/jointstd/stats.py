"""The inference layer of the joint standard.

Everything brandonmusic's standard asks for and our GLM-5.3 publications did
not carry: cluster-robust SEs, a window-level block bootstrap with BCa
intervals, sigma_run combined with the statistical SE in quadrature, McNemar on
paired top-1, and a percentile-exceedance guard that refuses to print a
quantile it cannot support.

THREE BACKENDS, and the receipt says which one produced the number.

  ``kld_eval``  his own implementation, imported not copied, used when
                numpy+scipy+pandas are importable.  Reproduces his published
                endpoints exactly because it IS his code.
  ``numpy``     our implementation driving numpy's PCG64 with his seed and his
                draw pattern.  Also reproduces his published endpoints exactly
                (verified: 24/24 BCa and percentile endpoints on his run1
                clean and panel scopes).
  ``stdlib``    our implementation on ``random.Random``.  Agrees within Monte
                Carlo error; used on interpreters with no numpy, which is the
                only environment ``registry/ make check`` is allowed to assume.

EQUAL-WEIGHT WINDOWS, AND THE CONDITION THAT MAKES THAT LEGAL.  His bootstrap
resamples windows and concatenates their per-TOKEN arrays.  Every window in this
panel is exactly 2047 scored positions, so the token-weighted mean of a resample
equals the plain mean of the resampled window means, and a bootstrap over window
means is the same estimator.  Our published receipts carry per-window means but
not per-token arrays, so this equivalence is what makes our existing rows
analysable at all.

``window_block_bootstrap`` below takes ONLY window means: it never sees a token
count and therefore always computes the EQUAL-WEIGHT mean, while
``se_from_window_summaries`` computes the TOKEN-WEIGHTED one.  On equal windows
those coincide exactly; on unequal windows they do not, and a receipt carrying
both would quote a BCa interval around a different point estimate than its own
headline mean.  The equivalence is therefore a precondition, not a property:
``bin/joint_standard.py::cmd_analyze`` checks the window sizes and REFUSES when
they differ (``--allow-unequal-windows`` to override deliberately), and
``registry/tools/joint_enrich.py`` runs only on 2047-position panels.

    interval far more often than below, so the intervals systematically
    understate divergence and produce false SEPARATIONS between domains.

    WHY log AND NOT THE RAW MEAN.  Bootstrap-t on the raw mean measures the same
    coverage but puts a NEGATIVE lower endpoint on every one of the 42 cells at
    least once across the simulation, and on 5 cells at their published values.
    A negative lower bound on a KL divergence is a worse publication defect than
    the undercoverage it fixes.  On the log scale the interval is non-negative by
    construction.

    Resamples that are degenerate (all g draws the same window, hence zero
    within-resample spread) carry no studentized value and are excluded from the
    t distribution rather than being given an infinite one; the count is
