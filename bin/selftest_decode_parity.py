"""Prove the EXL3/TR3 weight decode carries NO device offset, and time it.

Two claims underpin the whole local recipe, and both are checked here on the
machine in front of you rather than asserted from a design document:

  1. The decode is PURE PYTORCH.  Integer bit operations, a 65,536-entry fp16
     lookup, and two 128x128 Hadamard matmuls.  No custom kernel, no
     `torch.ops`, no exllamav3 build.  That is why the local recipe needs only
     `pip install torch safetensors numpy huggingface_hub` and none of the
     cloud bootstrap.
  2. It is BITWISE IDENTICAL across devices.  If MPS and CPU produce the same
     bits from the same payload, then a Mac installs exactly the weights the
     sealed lane installs, and any local-vs-sealed difference in the final
     number comes from the FORWARD PASS alone.  That is a much narrower and
     more defensible disclosure than "some device difference".

The functions under test are not copied.  They are extracted from the real
reader source by AST and executed, so this test cannot drift away from the
code it claims to check -- if the reader changes, this runs the changed code.
