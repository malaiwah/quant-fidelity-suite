Paid measurement is RunPod-only and SSH-only: one fresh secure-cloud
on-demand pod, one durable POST intent, one provider POST, verified result
retrieval, unconditional delete.  Four things are always enforced:
`--max-cost` caps the all-in liability; `--max-runtime` is an absolute
deadline in the lease, the on-pod watchdog and the provider; the pod is
destroyed on success, failure, exception and interrupt; and an installed
user-systemd reaper destroys it at the deadline if this process dies.

Strict campaign mode -- a cross-run ledger with explicit limits, foreign-pod
refusal, and an optional sealed controller-loss drill proof -- is opt-in via
`--campaign-ledger`.  `--dry-run` runs every check and creates nothing.

Run `bin/measure-cloud --help` for the full flag list and examples.

    runpod, vast and lambda -- three of the four providers -- that call raised
    on EVERY poll, `state` fell back to "", both the `failed` and the
    `succeeded` branches below became unreachable, and the loop degenerated to
    "wait for the done marker, or for `--max-runtime`". A stage that SUCCEEDS
    still ends the poll (its marker is authoritative). A stage that FAILS never
    does. `run_logs` had the identical signature mismatch, so the text
    fallback -- the one remaining way out -- could not read the log either, and
    its `except JLError: continue` swallowed the evidence.

    15:03:2x and at 15:12 the controller had not noticed, across four 120 s
    polls, with the instance ACTIVE and the GPU at 0%. On a Fruit-scale run

    `--max-runtime`, which is the "$3.07 sitting at 0% GPU" shape
    `docs/CLOUD-RECIPES.md` section 6 already warns about, arriving through a
    different door.
