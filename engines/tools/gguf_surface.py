"""GGUF (llama.cpp) checkpoint surface adapter for the streaming K6 scorer.

Scores community GGUF quantizations of GLM-5.3-Flash (unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF,
ddh0/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF, ...) on OUR sealed 25-window panel through the SAME
single-device streaming capture (``stream_score.py --source gguf``) used for
K6/K8/native-BF16, so the number lands on the same yardstick.

CRITICAL SCOPE DIFFERENCE from the EXL3/TR3 and Dione families: a GGUF
quantizes (nearly) EVERYTHING -- token_embd, output (lm_head), all attention /
KDA / DSA projections, shared experts, dense MLPs AND the routed experts.  Only
norms, conv1d kernels, router gates and a few scalar tensors are stored F32.
This adapter therefore supplies ALL tensors from the GGUF itself:

  * routed experts (layers 3..44) are sliced per expert out of the fused
    ``blk.L.ffn_{gate,up,down}_exps.weight`` tensors and streamed-decoded to
    BF16 through the shared install algebra (fp32 dequant, ONE bf16 rounding);
  * every non-routed tensor is decoded once into a MATERIALIZED safetensors
    view under the official HF names, and the sealed ``from_pretrained``
    constructor runs over that view unmodified;
  * the official BF16 tree is consulted ONLY for config/tokenizer files and the
    vision tower (``model.visual.*``), which the main GGUF does not carry (it
    ships as a separate mmproj file).  The receipt discloses this.

Format facts (measured from the live repos, 2026-08-29, header-level; see
gguf-evidence/):

  * unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL @ 2975ab41: llama.cpp v3 split (6 files, each a complete
    GGUF with its own tensor table; shard 1 carries all KV metadata and zero
    tensors), arch ``glm5next``, 1412 tensors: Q8_0 645 / F32 638 / Q4_K 84 /
    Q5_K 42 / Q6_K 3.  ddh0 @ be335b19: single file, arch spelled
    ``glm5-next``, IQ3_S/IQ4_XS experts (v1-REFUSED by type, see below).
  * ggml dims are stored fastest-first; the row-major (= official HF) shape is
    ``reversed(dims)``.  Fused expert tensors are [in, out, 288] -> expert e is
    a contiguous [out, in] block-aligned slice.  That slot-e-is-expert-e
    assumption is PROVEN, not assumed: ``audit_expert_placement`` scores the
    decoded slot against the official BF16 expert and gets rel-L2 0.0714 (the
    Q4_K error) vs 1.42 for every row-shifted control, which settles the slot
    ordering, the reversed-dims orientation and the projection mapping at once.
  * MLA split: HF ``self_attn.kv_b_proj.weight`` [32768, 512] does NOT exist in
    the GGUF; llama.cpp stores ``attn_k_b.weight`` (dims [256,512,64] --
    PER-HEAD TRANSPOSED) and ``attn_v_b.weight`` (dims [512,256,64]).  The
    reconstruction (per head h: concat(transpose(k_b[h]), v_b[h]) along the
    row axis, heads stacked) was PROVEN against the official BF16 tensor:
    rel-L2 0.0054 (the Q8_0 error) for this arrangement vs >= 1.40 for every
    other candidate (k/v swapped, non-interleaved).  The full 64-head audit is
    recorded in gguf-evidence/mla-full-audit.json and the offline selftest
    re-runs ``audit_mla_placement`` itself on a real head window.
  * Tensors the official tree stores F32 (hc_*_base/scale, A_log, dt_bias,
    e_score_correction_bias) are stored F32 in the GGUF too and pass through
    BYTE-EXACTLY; every other decoded tensor gets a single fp32 -> bf16
    rounding, so a GGUF that stores norms F32 (llama.cpp's convention) is
    DOWNCAST to the official bf16 rather than widening the model.  The policy
    is not trusted: ``verify_official_dtypes`` reads the official safetensors
    headers wherever those shards are present and refuses any disagreement.

Dequantization is plain PyTorch (uint8-level unpack, fp32 accumulation, no
float64, no int64 beyond gather indices -- MPS-safe) and is BITWISE equal to
gguf-py 0.19.0's reference ``dequantize`` for every supported type, proven on
real ranged-fetched tensors including full expert slices with sub-block scales
(Q4_K/Q5_K) -- the offline selftest re-proves it from committed fixtures.

SUPPORTED ggml types: F32, F16, BF16, Q8_0, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K (v1, the Flash
lane) plus Q3_K, IQ4_XS, IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S (2026-09-05, for the GLM-5.3 flagship
UD-Q3_K_XL / UD-IQ4_XS builds; each proven bitwise against gguf-py 0.19.0 on
real ranged-fetched blocks, gguf-evidence/dequant_*_ggufpy_ref.npy).  Measured
against every build in the Flash repo (gguf-evidence/unsloth-build-census.json,
each build's own 1,412-tensor table), that set scores BF16, Q8_0, UD-IQ4_XS,
UD-Q3_K_XL, UD-Q4_K_XL, UD-Q5_K_XL and UD-Q6_K_XL and refuses the five IQ1/IQ2
builds.  Note the refusals are NOT predictable from the directory names:
unsloth's "Dynamic" recipe mixes IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS/IQ4_XS into UD-Q2_K_XL and
IQ3_XXS/IQ4_XS into UD-Q3_K_XL.

Any unsupported type is REFUSED BY NAME AND TYPE at census time, before any
decode: adding a type means adding a kernel WITH the same bitwise-vs-gguf-py
proof, not silently skipping tensors.

TWO ARCHITECTURES, ONE DATA TABLE (``GgufArch``): ``glm5next`` (GLM-5.3-Flash,
above) and ``glm-dsa`` (the GLM-5.3 flagship, unsloth/GLM-5.3-GGUF @ 346b3591,
``GlmMoeDsaForCausalLM``): 78 decoder layers + MTP blk.78, dense layers 0-2,
256 routed experts of [2048, 6144], MLA with 64 heads x (nope 192 + v 256) over
kv_lora_rank 512 (kv_b_proj [28672, 512]), and a DSA indexer whose weights the
official tree carries on 22 "full" layers only -- the GGUF ships indexer
tensors on EVERY layer, the extra 285 being value-identical copies of the
preceding full layer's (stored BF16 where the parent is F32, so the proof
compares decoded values, never bytes).  Every mapping and layout choice for
glm-dsa was proven EXACTLY (uint16 bit patterns) against zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16 @
304b8051 by HTTP range requests -- the composed kv_b_proj over all 64 heads,
q_a/q_b/kv_a/o projections, dense and shared FFNs, routed expert slots 0/128/
255, the indexer, embed/head/norm windows and the MTP block --
gguf-evidence/glmdsa-layout-audit.json; the tokenizer array order equals the
official vocab (glmdsa-tokenizer-order-audit.json).  ``materialize_layer`` is
the per-layer reader the layer-outer streamer (``gguf-dequant-to-bf16``)
calls: one decoder layer's tensors under their official names, decoded on the
capture device, kv_b composed, experts sliced, ONE bf16 rounding.

DISCLOSED DEVIATION - unsealed-source scoring: community GGUFs ship no encoder
receipts, no reconstruction closures and no sealed reader ABI.  The adapter
records whole-file sha256 for every GGUF it consumes plus the immutable repo
revision, and every receipt carries ``seal_disclosure`` saying exactly that
(the Dione precedent, engines/tools/dione_surface.py).

    are not rewritten for it -- they are the same lines, in the same order, on a
    tensor that happens to live somewhere else.

    Why that keeps the bitwise property.  Every operation in these kernels is
    either an integer op on uint8/int8 (shift, mask, or, reinterpret) or an IEEE
    754 binary32 multiply or subtract on an elementwise-shaped operand.  Both
    classes are exactly specified and device-independent: there is no reduction,
    no matmul (so no TF32 path), and in eager mode no fusion that could turn the
    ``dd * q - dm`` pair into an FMA with a different rounding.  Proven, not
    assumed: `engines/tools/selftest_gguf_offline.py` rung 1b re-decodes the same
    committed REAL ranged-fetched bytes on whatever accelerator the host has and
    demands ``torch.equal`` against the CPU output that rung 1 already proved
    bitwise-equal to gguf-py 0.19.0.  On this laptop that is MPS; on the rented
    box it is CUDA, and it runs there BEFORE the capture, which is the only
    place the check is worth anything.

    Speed is the point.  Measured on the box (docs/GGUF-MEASUREMENT.md), the CPU
    path costs ~39 ms per expert matrix while the GPU sits at 2-4% -- and the
    fp32 result it then has to hand over is 33.5 MB per matrix, 7.1x the 4.7 MB
    of quantized bytes this path sends instead.
