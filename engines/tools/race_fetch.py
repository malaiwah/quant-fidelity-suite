"""Priority-ordered, overlapped checkpoint fetch for the layer-outer schedule.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`engines/tools/layer_outer.py` runs

    for each layer:  load it once;  for each window: push that window through it;  free it

Layer N's weights are not read until the capture reaches layer N.  The default
pipeline nevertheless waits for the WHOLE checkpoint to land before the first
window is pushed, because `stage_measure.sh fetch_target` is a separate stage
that must complete before `capture` starts.  For a model that lands on the Hub
at 09:00 and gets quantized by four people by 11:00, those serialized hours are
the entire race.

This module makes the fetch a PRIORITY QUEUE instead of a barrier:

  * the tiny files first -- `config.json`, the tokenizer, and above all
    `model.safetensors.index.json`, whose `weight_map` is what makes everything
    below plannable at all;
  * then the RESIDENT set: every shard holding a tensor that is not a decoder
    layer (embeddings, the final norm, `lm_head`, router biases, rotary tables).
    `build_streamed_model` loads all of those before the first layer;
  * then the shards holding layer 0, layer 1, ... in that order;
  * everything else keeps downloading in the background at full speed while the
    capture runs.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
It does not change a single number.  It changes WHEN bytes arrive, never which
bytes, never the order of any arithmetic, never the schedule the windows are
pushed through.  A race-mode capture and a fetch-then-capture capture of the
same checkpoint produce the same `capture_content_digest`; `bin/selftest_race_mode.py`
asserts exactly that rather than asserting it here.

THE HEAD IS NEEDED FIRST, NOT LAST
----------------------------------
The obvious guess -- "the final norm and `lm_head` are needed last, so fetch
them last" -- is WRONG for this capture path, and getting it wrong would
deadlock the run at layer 0.  `build_streamed_model` performs one resident load
of everything outside the decoder stack BEFORE any layer is streamed, and
refuses if any non-layer parameter is still on the meta device; `hf_capture`
then reads `head.weight.shape` for the vocab/hidden sizes and registers its tap
as a pre-hook ON the head.  And a hidden-form dataset must publish the head's
own tensor bytes, because `compare` refuses a hidden-form capture with a null
head content digest (HEAD-4, no override).  So the head is a priority-0 file on
every form we publish.  Priority is derived from the checkpoint's own
`weight_map`, never from a guess about which tensors "come last".

MIS-BUCKETING IS CONSERVATIVE BY CONSTRUCTION
---------------------------------------------
A shard's priority is the MINIMUM layer index over every decoder tensor it
carries, and any key the layer regex does not match falls into the resident
bucket.  So the two ways the regex can be wrong on an unfamiliar architecture
both fetch a shard EARLIER than strictly needed (a vision tower's
`...encoder.layers.N.` keys pull their shard forward; an unmatched decoder
spelling pulls its shard into priority 0).  Neither can make the gate release a
layer whose bytes have not landed -- and if the plan were wrong in that
direction anyway, `layer_outer.audit_checkpoint_tree` refuses the short or
absent shard before a window is pushed through it.  The gate is an
optimisation; the audit is the guard.

Stdlib only, except for the DEFAULT downloader (`huggingface_hub`), which the
caller may replace -- and the tests do, which is what lets the scheduling be
measured offline in seconds instead of rented.
