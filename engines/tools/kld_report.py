"""fp64 tokenwise KLD vs the fp32 teacher + five-cold-run aggregation (K6/K6K8).

Adapted from brandonmusic's measure_glm53_packed_student_kld.py and
aggregate_glm53_five_run_kld.py, joined into the single CLI stage_campaign.sh pins:

  kld_report.py --profile k6 --teacher <tree> --runs run1 ... run5 \
      --fp8-baseline 0.020615 --k4-baseline 0.024555 \
      --out k6-packed-kld.json --five-run-out k6-five-run-kld.json \
      --comparison-out comparison-table.md

Per run it computes (or resumes) the sealed per-run KLD report
(quant-pipeline.glm53-packed-student-kld.v2): exact fp64 log-softmax,
teacher->student direction, the sealed 25-window final panel only
(25 x 2047 = 51,175 positions), mean = upstream's estimator exactly (no
weighting, no bf16 anywhere).  For profile k6 it then seals the packed-KLD
receipt chain through the patched glm53_k6_postmtp module (patches-v2 0005) and,
with five runs, the five-cold-run receipt (bitwise determinism shows as one
identical tokenwise_kld_sha256).  Profile k6k8 gets a malaiwah.* summary
receipt (its sealed schema set ships with the K6K8 support module).
