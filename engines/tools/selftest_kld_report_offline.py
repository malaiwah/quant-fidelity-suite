"""Offline regression tests for engines/tools/kld_report.py.  No GPU, no network, no
`quant_pipeline` checkout.

`selftest_offline.py` needs a real quant_pipeline tree, which a public clone does not
have (`engines/.patchwork/*/runtime/src/quant_pipeline` ships without an `__init__.py`), so
the aggregation and provenance logic in the summary branch had NO test that runs on this
machine at all.  Every defect below was live in a tool that produces published numbers.

The trick that makes this cheap: `_measure_run` RESUMES from an existing
`kld-report.json` without recomputing, so a run directory holding a hand-written report
exercises the whole aggregation path with no logits and no torch.  The few
`quant_pipeline` symbols the module imports at call time are stubbed.
Real arithmetic checks additionally use local torch/safetensors when available:
known-answer fp64 KL, finite-input overflow refusal, and a 25-window tiny-vocabulary
capture with final short blocks. Missing optional dependencies are reported as SKIP.

  NUM-01  a resumed report measured against a DIFFERENT teacher must refuse
  NUM-02  the headline of an N-run summary is the aggregate, not run 1
  NUM-03  two run dirs holding ONE capture are not two cold runs
  NUM-06  the summary carries per_window, or a published row can never be rescoped
  NUM-07  no profile claims a storage layout it does not have
  NUM-09  a resumed report scored at a different position_block must refuse
  NUM-13  --five-run-out must not be accepted and silently ignored
  NUM-14  a malformed sibling receipt must not crash the comparison table
  NUM-15  the provenance branch dispatches on the capture SURFACE, not on a
          profile-name prefix (LESSON 48 recurring on a fourth profile)
  NUM-17  per-window top-1 integer counts make subset rescoring exact
  NUM-18  public TR3 scoring refuses capture/profile checkpoint identity mismatch
  NUM-19  real forward KL matches an independent probability-space oracle
  NUM-20  finite inputs that overflow intermediate arithmetic are refused
