"""Portable hidden-form capture: an HF checkpoint + a token panel -> a SEALED fidelity dataset.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`bin/fidelity-dataset capture` documented a three-step architecture whose step 1
could not be run by anybody outside our own campaign:

  * it delegates to ``engines/tools/hidden_replay.py``, which was never committed to
    the public repository, so a fresh clone cannot capture at all;
  * that wrapper hard-codes ``HIDDEN_WIDTH = 4096`` and
    ``EXPECTED_VOCAB = 154880``, i.e. GLM-5.3-Flash's exact geometry, so it
    refuses every other checkpoint including the public 0.1B architectural
    fixture;
  * it drives ``stream_score.py``, our sealed streaming engine, which needs the
    campaign's sealed-corpus machinery; and
  * having run, it wrote a *capture tree*, never the dataset the ``--out`` flag
    promised.

This module is the missing counterpart: one forward pass per panel window
through a plain ``transformers`` model, the lm_head input tapped with a forward
pre-hook, and the result assembled into a dataset that
``docs/FIDELITY-DATASET-SPEC.md`` accepts.  It has no GLM-5.3-Flash constants
and no dependency on ``stream_score.py``; it works for any causal LM whose
``get_output_embeddings()`` is a bias-free ``nn.Linear``-shaped head.

THE CUT (state it, never assume it)
-----------------------------------
The captured tensor is the model's final hidden state as handed to ``lm_head``
-- i.e. after the text model's final norm and immediately before the head
matmul -- taken as the head module's INPUT via ``register_forward_pre_hook``.
Replay applies the head ONLY.  This is the same cut as
``engines/tools/hidden_replay.py`` and as Festr's kimi-k3 hidden-replay convention,
which is what makes the two artifact families comparable.

Storage consequence: a hidden-form record costs ``hidden_size * 2`` bytes per
scored position, a logit-form record ``vocab_size * 4``.  The manifest records
both so the ratio is arithmetic, not a claim.

Determinism
-----------
This tool captures ONE cold run.  Cross-run determinism is not asserted here --
it is established by capturing twice in two separate processes and running
``fidelity-dataset compare --self-compare``, which is the spec's SC-1
reproduction confirmation.  The ``determinism`` block therefore declares
``run_count: 1`` and names the self-compare as the outstanding evidence, rather
than claiming an identity this process never observed.

    `dsmanifest.capture_runtime` has carried a `container` block since the
    format landed and nothing has ever filled it, so every capture this repo
    has sealed says `image_digest: null` whether it ran in a pinned container
    or on a hand-bootstrapped box.  A containerised capture can answer, and the
    convention for how is already in this tree: `fidelity/stackprint.py` reads
    `STACKPRINT_IMAGE_PIN`, falling back to a pin FILE, precisely because
    `docker load` strips the registry digest and the file is then the only
    trustworthy source.

    Two properties this must keep, and a test asserts both:

    * With no pin present it returns None, so `capture_runtime` uses the same
      all-null default it always did and a non-container capture's bytes are
      UNCHANGED.  A published dataset must not shift because a field learned
      how to be filled.
    * It is not an input to `stack_fingerprint_sha256`.  That digest is what
      `dscompare` reads to decide `stack_relation`, and a cross-stack verdict
      stamps `usable_as_floor: false`.  The container is where the stack ran,
      not what the stack IS -- so recording it must not make a containerised
      capture incomparable with the identical computation run outside one.

    mechanisms, both structural:

      * IDENTITY -- the preview's `dataset.id` differs from the final's, and
        `bin/fidelity/dscompare.py` uses exactly that field as the `reference_id`
        input to `registry_lib.comparability_key`. Different reference_id means a
        different comparability group, which the renderer draws as a different
        table and the validator refuses to merge. This is the same mechanism
        `docs/DESIGNATED-REFERENCE.md` relies on, for the same reason.
      * PUBLISHABILITY -- `not_submittable: true` is a marker
        `bin/fidelity/receipt.py::_scan_for_unsubmittable` refuses at any depth,
        and the blocking disclosure below is what `emit_submission`'s SC-5 check
        refuses on. Neither is new machinery.

    Updating a published root in place is the failure this exists to prevent:
    the identity would stay the same while the CONTENT changed, so rows measured
    against the old bytes and rows measured against the new bytes would land in
