"""The layer-outer, window-inner capture schedule -- and the streaming residency it needs.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`engines/tools/hf_capture.py` captures a panel the obvious way: load the model, then
push one window at a time through the whole stack.  For a checkpoint that does
not fit in memory that is the wrong loop order, and the cost is not compute --
it is WEIGHT LOADING.  `docs/GLM53-ROOT-FEASIBILITY.md` puts the number on it:
`zai-org/GLM-5.3-BF16` materialises 1,486.8 GB, which is larger than any RAM
configuration we can rent, so the window-outer schedule cannot run at all; the
`--device-map` paths that make it *expressible* pay ~358 GB of host-to-device
traffic per window (B-1) or write a second full 1,486.8 GB copy to disk (B-2).

This module inverts the loop:

    for each layer:  load it once;  for each window: push that window through it;  free it

Every layer's weights are materialised **exactly once for the whole panel**
instead of once per window, and only one layer is resident at a time.

THE NUMBERS DO NOT MOVE
-----------------------
This is a *scheduling* change, never an arithmetic one.  Windows are pushed
through each layer **sequentially, one at a time**, never batched: batching
would change the reduction order of the matmuls and therefore change the
numbers, and a measurement whose numbers moved is worth nothing.  The engine
exists to make a measurement POSSIBLE, not to make it faster.

How bit-identity is obtained, and why it is structural rather than hoped for
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The naive implementation of a layer-outer loop re-implements the model's
forward: embeddings, position ids, the causal-mask mapping, the rotary
embeddings, the per-layer kwargs, the carried state, the final norm.  Every one
of those is a chance to differ from `transformers` by a detail, and several of
them are architecture-specific in ways that bite exactly on the architecture we
care about.  `GlmMoeDsaModel.forward` threads a SECOND value between layers --

    hidden_states, topk_indices = decoder_layer(..., prev_topk_indices=topk_indices)

-- the DSA indexer's shared top-k selection, which only the `full` indexer
layers recompute; and `Glm5NextTextModel.forward` carries a hyper-channel
dimension (`hc_mult`) plus a different mask builder.  A re-implementation that
knows about "hidden states" and not about those is silently wrong.

So this module re-implements NOTHING.  It runs the model's own
`forward` once per (layer, window) and replaces only the decoder layers with
proxies:

  * a proxy for a layer BELOW the one being computed returns, verbatim, the
    value that layer's successor produced on the previous outer iteration --
    the whole return value, whatever its shape, so `topk_indices` and any other
    carried state ride along untouched;
  * the proxy for the layer being computed calls the real layer and memoises
    its return value;
  * a proxy for a layer ABOVE it raises `_Suspend`, which unwinds the forward.

The model's own prologue therefore builds the embeddings, position ids, masks
and rotary embeddings; the model's own loop body computes the per-layer kwargs
and threads the carried state; the model's own epilogue runs the final norm and
the head.  The only thing this file decides is WHEN each layer runs.  The
per-window arithmetic is the same operations, in the same order, on the same
inputs -- which is why the capture digests compare equal rather than close.

The price is that the prologue is recomputed once per (layer, window) instead
of once per window.  It is an embedding gather, a mask build and a rotary
table: microseconds against a layer of a 753B-parameter MoE.  It is paid on
purpose, to buy an implementation that cannot drift from the model's own code.

Streaming residency
-------------------
Reordering the loop is only half of it.  If the model is fully resident the new
order saves nothing, so this module also builds the model on the meta device
and materialises **one layer at a time** through `transformers`' own
`convert_and_load_state_dict_in_model` -- the same converter, the same
`WeightConverter` chain that fuses 256 per-expert matrices into one tensor, the
same dtype plan.  Reusing it rather than re-deriving the fusion is what makes
the streamed weights byte-identical to the `from_pretrained` weights; that
identity is asserted directly by `selftest_layer_outer.py`, not assumed.

`--layer-residency resident` keeps the new loop order over a fully loaded model.
It buys nothing operationally and exists so that a digest mismatch can be
attributed: `resident` isolates the schedule, `stream` adds the loader.

THE TRAP THIS LOADER WALKS INTO, AND THE GUARD FOR IT
-----------------------------------------------------
Stage A found that `transformers` enumerates each shard's OWN safetensors
header rather than the checkpoint's pruned `model.safetensors.index.json`.  A
per-layer loader reads shard headers directly, so it inherits the same
exposure: against a sparsely-fetched tree a tensor can be *named* by a header
whose bytes were never fetched, and a short read is not an error -- it is
ZEROS, and zeros load without complaint.  `audit_checkpoint_tree` refuses
before the first window on the two signatures that produces: a shard shorter
than its own header requires, and a header/index key-set disagreement.

    `shards` restricts the audit to a NAMED SUBSET, for the overlapped fetch of

    shards for layer N+1 may legitimately still be downloading, and auditing
    them would refuse a tree that is merely incomplete-so-far.  The subset audit
    is not weaker on what it covers -- each named shard is still checked against
    its own header length, and the index/header key-set comparison is still
    exact, restricted on BOTH sides to the named shards.  Every shard is audited
    exactly once, immediately before the first load that reads it.

    enumerates each shard's own header, not the pruned index.  A loader that
    reads shards directly -- which this one does, per layer -- can therefore be
    handed a tensor NAME whose BYTES were never fetched.  safetensors does not
    treat a short file as an error at open time; the tensor reads as zeros, the
    load reports nothing, and the capture is a confident measurement of a hole.

    Two signatures are checked, both cheap and both before the first window:

      1. a shard whose on-disk size is smaller than its own header requires --
         the signature of a range-fetched or interrupted download;
      2. a shard header and the checkpoint index disagreeing about which keys
         exist, in either direction -- the signature of a pruned index over a
         complete shard (extra header keys) or a truncated tree (missing ones).

    What it does NOT catch, stated so nobody relies on it: a shard that is the
    right LENGTH but whose bytes were written as zeros (a sparse-file fetch),
    and any corruption that preserves length.  Only a content digest catches
    those, and the checkpoint identity `hf_capture` already computes is that
    digest -- for the tree as a whole, once.

    promoted to fp32, multiplied ONCE by its block's scale in fp32, and cast
    once to `output_dtype` (round to nearest even). No accumulation, no fused
    multiply-add, no device-dependent kernel.

    Full blocks: bitwise `transformers` `Fp8Dequantize._dequantize_one`, which

    #
    #   * FP4-packed experts (deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731): the packed
