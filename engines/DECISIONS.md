## Operator design inputs (2026-08-27)
1. K6K8 mixed precision: IMPLEMENT support in the pinned pipeline (operator
   directive) — prior art: operator's Qwen3.8-27B multi-K recipe + GLM-5.2
   mixed lineage (NVFP4-TR3-Hybrid, willfalco, madeby561). K6-uniform ships
   first and never blocks on the K6K8 patch set.
2. Shared suh/svh across routed experts (per layer): evaluate for performance
   (one activation Hadamard transform per layer vs per expert on the
   grouped_gemm path) IF the KLD cost is ~nil. Decide via layerwise A/B on the
   captured activations dataset (quantize a few representative expert layers
   shared vs per-expert, replay block inputs, compare output divergence) BEFORE
   committing full conversions. Operator research link PENDING — fold in when
   provided. Check pinned exllamav3 + materializer/storage-ABI support for
   shared sign vectors before assuming feasibility.
3. TOPOLOGY-NEUTRAL QUANT (operator directive 2026-08-27): the published
   checkpoint must not bake in a TP/EP topology. Publish canonical unsharded
   tensors (his format's output_root/native side, not a TP-packed layout);
   any packing for a specific TP happens at load/deploy time. Design must map
   which materializer steps depend on target_tensor_parallel /
   qualified_tp_sizes and keep those OUT of the published artifact (or publish
   canonical + validate load on TP2 AND TP4). Shared-suh (item 2) is
   compatible: the per-layer input transform is replicated across ranks.
4. Shared-suh finding (from operator's qwen38 P3.1 + his 4bpw index audit):
   Brandon's 4bpw is fully per-expert/per-projection suh+svh (288x3 per MoE
   layer, no sharing/merging). P3.1-style shared input-suh + per-component svh
   would be a format IMPROVEMENT but requires runtime changes to exploit →
   K6-uniform ships in HIS exact format first; shared-suh is a gated
   experiment (layerwise A/B on activations dataset) after K6K8.
5. PROVEN ENV RECIPE (L4 smoke rounds 1-5, 2026-08-27): python3.12 (deadsnakes
   on 22.04 VM) + torch==2.11.0 --index-url .../whl/cu130 (matches VM CUDA 13.0
   toolkit AND Brandon's recorded stack) + transformers==5.16.1 + flash-attn
   2.8.3 via cu13torch2.10 cxx11abiTRUE cp312 wheel (imports fine on torch
   2.11; NO torch2.11 wheel exists; source build fails) + kbnf +
   formatron==0.5.0 + pydantic==2.5.3 (0.5.0 breaks on newer pydantic:
   pydantic.typing.Type; 0.4.11 breaks differently) + accelerate safetensors
   ninja packaging rich tokenizers pillow + xformers optional-warning-only +
   pip install --no-deps git+exllamav3@c5d9c657. Verified: `import exllamav3;
   from exllamav3 import ext` GREEN on SM89/CUDA13. Fixture forward WORKS
   stock on torch 2.11 (scatter int32 bug is torch<=2.6-era only).
   TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST: 8.9 L4 / 9.0 H100+H200.
6. K6 IS A BUILT-IN PROFILE (miner receipt): glm53_direct_k4.py L53
   SUPPORTED_BITS=(4,6); k6 recipe ids + contract/materialization schemas +
   publication profile (bits=6, tp=4) all pre-exist. K6-uniform requires NO
   code edits. K8 needs codec adapter admission (L175) + 128-word trellis
   verification; runtime derives per-module K from trellis shape (L501) —
   serving structurally mixed-ready behind ~6 surgical validators.
7. K8-UNIFORM CAMPAIGN (operator directive 2026-08-27 evening): encode a full
   K8-uniform routed-expert set with the SAME calibration/transform-seed/
   parameters as K6, on the same P1 rental. Purpose: (a) shippable ~315 GiB
   near-BF16 flagship (fits TP4); (b) complete per-choice payload parts bin so
   future multi-precision K6K8 ("where it counts") is OFFLINE ASSEMBLY, not
   re-encode. Uniform K8 keeps single-rate invariants — enablement is
   admission-only (SUPPORTED_BITS+=8, recipe id/schemas, codec adapter rate,
   128-word trellis in readers/materializer schema strings). Mixed-rate
   serving relaxation stays future assembly-time work.
8. ARCHIVE THE PREP + PARTS BIN ON HF (operator directive 2026-08-27 late):
   P4 publishes, beyond the checkpoints: (a) per-layer preparation manifests,
   GSS/normalization profiles, sealed contract/launch-plans/state chains,
   K4 bridge doc, transform seed, shared-suh A/B receipt — the full
   reproducibility record; (b) the K6 and K8 PAYLOAD STORES (~254+338 GB)
   as a public parts-bin dataset so anyone can do offline mixed-precision
   assembly (K6K8 "where it counts") without GPUs. Naming:
   malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-6bpw + -K8 (models),
   malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-partsbin-v1 (dataset: payloads + prep +
   receipts). All cards cross-link the fidelity suite + Brandon's pipeline.
9. NAMING (2026-08-28, operator relaying turboderp via rtx6kpro discord): do
   NOT name the quants "EXL3" — they are not stock-exllamav3-loadable (no
   glm5_next arch upstream). Family name = TR3 (the trellis/MCG codec, per
   the GLM-5.2 TR3 lineage and Brandon's own recipe "EXL3/TR3 MCG"). Repos:
   malaiwah/GLM-5.3-Flash-TR3-6bpw, -TR3-8bpw, -TR3-partsbin-v1. Cards
   credit exllamav3 kernels + Brandon's pipeline/runtime and state the
   codec-vs-runtime distinction plainly. GG/SIQ rejected: they name serving
   stacks, not the artifact format.
10. DETERMINISM CHECKS HASH CONTENT, NOT CONTAINERS (2026-08-28, learned the
   hard way twice in one hour): capture receipts embed elapsed_seconds and
   backend telemetry; safetensors embed __metadata__ (cold_run, identities).
   Both containers ALWAYS differ between runs even when the computation is
   bit-exact. Valid determinism artifacts: raw tensor bytes, or the sealed
   tokenwise_kld_sha256. Verified consequence: 0xSero's Dione Q4 IS bitwise
   deterministic through our reader (max_abs_diff 0.0 over 2047x154,880
   logits) — the property now holds across two independently-produced
   checkpoints in different layouts (canonical vs TP4-sliced).
