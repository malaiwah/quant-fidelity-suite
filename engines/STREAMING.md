# Streaming single-device scorer for the sealed GLM-5.3-Flash panel

`tools/stream_score.py` scores the sealed 25-window / 51,175-position fidelity
panel on **one** GPU (or a 128 GB Mac, or CPU) instead of the 8× H200 box the
sealed protocol used. It uses the same `transformers` model and module classes,
but changes residency and emulates the distributed expert combine. That combine
does not reproduce every native NCCL rounding step; see the measured bridge below.

---

## 1. Why one GPU is enough

The sealed scorer (`tools/student_capture.py`) calls
`glm53_packed_k4_reader.load_complete_surface()` and then
`install_local_main_experts()`, which decodes **every** routed expert to BF16 up
front and holds it resident for the whole run. Measured from the sealed
receipts (`receipts/k6-student-run1/backend.json`):

| | sealed EP8 |
|---|---|
| resident per rank | 95,112,933,376 B (88.58 GiB) |
| ranks | 8 |
| install time per rank | 782.34 s for 4,536 matrices (**172 ms/matrix**) |
| capture (25 windows) | 139.58 s |

Those 8 GPUs are rented for **residency**, not compute. The panel is
25 × 2048 tokens; the whole forward is ≈1.7 PFLOP, well under a minute of H200
math, and the sealed run reports ~25 % utilisation.

Byte budget, computed from the released BF16 index and confirmed at runtime:

| component | bytes | GB |
|---|---:|---:|
| non-routed (1,618 checkpoint tensors: KDA, DSA/MLA, indexer, mHC, routers, norms, dense 0–2, shared experts, embed, lm_head, vision tower) | 18,976,485,628 | **18.98** |
| routed experts, **one layer** (288 experts × 3 projections, BF16) | 14,495,514,624 | **14.50** |
| routed experts, all 42 executed layers | 608,811,614,208 | 608.8 |
| activations, **measured** (fp32 eager attention scores + fp32 logit staging + decode transients) | 13,600,000,000 | **13.60** |

Streaming one layer at a time therefore measures at **47.08 GB peak** on CUDA
(`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated`, 2048-token window). The activation figure
above is derived from that measurement, not guessed, so `--vram-budget-gb` does
not lie to a user with a smaller card.

> **Corrections to the brief.** Non-routed is 18.98 GB, not ~34 GB. The panel
> hidden state at a layer boundary is 4× the naive figure because mHC carries
> `hc_mult = 4` residual streams (`[B, S, 4, 4096]`). And the 1× H200 spot
> container is capped at a **300 GiB cgroup limit** even though the host reports
> 3,019 GB — a 42-layer host-RAM decode cache (609 GB) is OOM-killed at layer
> ~22 if you trust `free`. `stream_score.py` reads the cgroup limit and caches
> only what fits.

---

## 2. Parity anatomy — what actually differs

This was verified against the installed `transformers` 5.16.1 source, not
assumed.

**The sealed run applied the EP plan ONLY, not a TP plan.**
`PreTrainedModel.tp_plan` (`transformers/distributed/mixin.py:87-97`) returns
`self._ep_plan` whenever `distributed_config.enable_expert_parallel` is true;
`apply_tensor_parallelism` consumes that property. The `active_tp_plan` field in
the sealed `backend.json` is the *stored attribute* `_tp_plan`, recorded for
provenance — it was never applied. Independent numerical confirmation:
88.58 GiB/rank = 608.8/8 GB routed + ~19 GB non-routed, which is only consistent
with attention / KDA / DSA / mHC / dense / shared-experts / embed / lm_head being
**fully replicated on every rank**.

⇒ Every op outside the routed-MoE block was already a single-device op.

**The sealed run used `grouped_mm`, not the eager expert loop.** The sealed
capture passes no `experts_implementation`, and
`get_correct_experts_implementation(None)` resolves to `"grouped_mm"`
(`modeling_utils.py:1964-1986`). Verified empirically by rebuilding the model
exactly as the sealed capture did and reading the dispatch:

```
top config._experts_implementation : grouped_mm
DISPATCHED EXPERTS FORWARD         : grouped_mm_experts_forward
```

This matters: the fallback `Glm5NextTextExperts.forward` accumulates with
`index_add_` in **bf16** and is CUDA-nondeterministic. `stream_score.py` forces
and records `grouped_mm`.

**So the only mechanical difference is the routed-expert combine, in 42 layers:**

```
EP8   partial_r = bf16( fp32 sum over the top-k slots rank r owns )     # ~5 of 8 ranks are nonzero
      out       = NCCL bf16 all_reduce( partial_0 … partial_7 )
EP1   out       = bf16( fp32 sum over all 8 top-k slots )
```

`grouped_mm_experts_forward` computes `weighted_out.view(T, 8, H).sum(dim=1)` in
fp32 and rounds **once** to bf16. Under EP8 that rounding happens **per rank**,
and the ~5 nonzero bf16 partials are then summed by NCCL in a topology-dependent
order (ring chunking, or NVLS in-switch reduction on an NVSwitch node).

`stream_score.py --ep-emulate 8` reproduces the EP8 partition exactly on one
device — same `EpRouterParallel` masking, same 36-group `torch._grouped_mm`
launch shape, same per-rank bf16 rounding — leaving **only the reduction order**
as a residual. `--reduce-order {fp32,sequential,reverse,pairwise,rotate:N}`
enumerates the candidates so that residual is *measured*, not asserted.

```

**Model construction.** The sealed capture built the student with
`AutoModelForImageTextToText.from_pretrained(bf16, dtype=bfloat16, …)` and then
overwrote only `mlp.experts.{gate_up_proj,down_proj}` for layers 3–44. Reading
all 599 GB to discard 580 GB of it is precisely the residency cost this tool
removes, so the streaming build calls **the same constructor** over a directory
whose `model.safetensors.index.json` lists only the 1,618 non-routed checkpoint
tensors and whose shards are symlinks to the real ones. The
checkpoint→module key conversion (which fuses `q/k/v_conv1d` → `conv1d` and
renames `hc_attn_*` → `attn_hc.*`), buffer construction, dtype handling and
`post_init` are therefore transformers' own, not re-implemented.

The routed expert `nn.Parameter`s are removed at construction (replaced by
0-element placeholders so `_init_weights` stays a no-op) and re-bound to the
slab. That is the entire delta, and it is asserted from the loader's own report:

```
missing_keys 0   mismatched_keys 0   error_msgs 0
unexpected_keys 84  ==  exactly {layers 3..44} × {gate_up_proj, down_proj}
```

Anything else unloaded is a hard failure.

**Independent cross-check of the routed half.** The streaming run's
`verified_packed_payload_bytes` is **228,750,407,424** — exactly
8 × 28,593,800,928, the per-rank figure in the sealed `backend.json`. The single
device verified byte-for-byte the same total packed payload the 8 sealed ranks
did between them, and `census_closes_main_routed_surface` confirms all
42 × 288 × 3 = 36,288 matrices were installed.

**Streaming.** `install_streaming_experts` replaces `experts.forward` with a
wrapper that (a) refills the slab for the layer about to run and (b) applies the
EP emulation. Because the wrapper sits *inside* the model, the per-window call
is byte-for-byte the sealed one:

```python
model(input_ids=ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, use_cache=False, return_dict=True).logits[:, :-1, :]
```

with batch 1, seq 2048, `attn_implementation="eager"`, tf32 off,
`float32_matmul_precision("highest")`, stored fp32 after
`mask[:-1] & mask[1:]` boolean selection. MTP layer 45 is receipt-gated and
never executed.

**Weight sources.** `--source payload-store` reads the content-addressed store
directly (`out-k6/payload-store`), so **no materialized checkpoint and no 254 GB
download is needed**. `--source checkpoint` takes the materialized path.
Byte-equality with the sealed surface is not an assumption: `load_decoded_choice`
re-verifies `packed_payload_sha256` and `checkpoint_payload_sha256` against the
sealed choice descriptor on **every** load, and the run's own
`checkpoint_identity_sha256` (a hash over inventory + contract + all 42 main
layer receipts + MTP receipts + reader ABI) is compared against the sealed one:

```
stream  checkpoint_identity_sha256 = a8668be3592493035e98a52994e0e3c43548a9757eadb79f7ae939f2f32de1c1
sealed  checkpoint_identity_sha256 = a8668be3592493035e98a52994e0e3c43548a9757eadb79f7ae939f2f32de1c1   ✓
```

This also unlocks scoring a parts-bin assembly with **no materialization at all**.

## 4. Memory model and schedules

`--vram-budget-gb` picks the largest schedule that fits; `--slab-experts`
overrides it.

| schedule | slab | device peak | notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| whole layer (default) | 288 experts, 14.50 GB | **47.08 GB measured** | required for `--sweep`; allows any `--ep-emulate` |
| one EP group | 36 experts, 1.81 GB | **34.40 GB measured** | memory floor; pairs with `--ep-emulate 8` (the group *is* a rank's shard). Bit-identical to slab 288 (§7.3); 44 % slower decode. |

`--decode-cache {none,ram,disk}` trades host memory for repeated decode. With
`none`, each window re-decodes all 42 layers; with `ram`/`disk`, layer L is
decoded once and paged in per window. The RAM cache is **cgroup-aware** and
refuses to exceed 80 % of the container limit rather than being OOM-killed.

| cache | host cost | per-window cost after the first | fits the 1× H200 spot container? |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `none` | 0 | full re-decode (~7 min) | yes |
| `ram` | 609 GB for all 42 layers | 42 × 14.5 GB H2D | **no** (300 GiB cgroup → ~19 layers) |
| `disk` | 609 GB | 42 × 14.5 GB from NVMe | yes on `/` (702 GB free) |

---

## 5. Measured performance and cost

Box: JarvisLabs machine 485591, 1× H200 (143,771 MiB), 28 vCPU, 300 GiB cgroup,
400 GB local NVMe, `$1.99/h`. Payload store staged to local disk first.

| stage | measured |
|---|---|
| stage 219 GB payload store fs → local NVMe | ~4 min, 16 parallel streams |
| sealed-surface verification (37,152 choices) | 21.0 s |
| model build (1,618 non-routed tensors) + device move | ~16 s |
| **decode, 36,288 matrices (slab 288)** | **397.0 s = 10.94 ms/matrix** |
| decode, 36,288 matrices (slab 36, low-memory schedule) | 570.6 s = 15.72 ms/matrix |
| forward, 1 window (2048 tokens), excluding decode | ~2 s |
| peak device memory, slab 288 / slab 36 | **47.08 GB / 34.40 GB** |
| single-window capture, end to end | **~8 min ≈ $0.27** |
| offline L1 ladder (CPU only) | ~40 s |

**The decode is 15.8× faster per matrix than the sealed run** (10.94 ms vs
172 ms). The sealed install was network-fs-read bound at 36.6 MB/s per rank; a
local store plus a 24-thread IO/SHA pool overlapping GPU decode removes that.

Projected full panel (25 windows):

| configuration | wall clock | cost @ $1.99/h |
|---|---|---|
| `--decode-cache none` (re-decode per window) | ~2.8 h | ~$5.6 |
| `--decode-cache ram`, capped at the 300 GiB cgroup (~19 of 42 layers) | ~1.8 h | ~$3.6 |
| sealed lane, 5 cold runs on 8× H200 | 2.37 h × 8 GPUs | ~$36–57 |

A full-panel `--decode-cache disk` (609 GB) fits on `/` but is **not** faster on
this box: the backing device delivers ~900 MB/s, so paging 609 GB per window
costs ~11 min against ~7 min to re-decode. On a host with a fast local NVMe or
≥700 GB of usable RAM it is the right choice; measure before assuming.

Two cold runs (the L4-justified N) therefore cost roughly **$7–11** on one spot
GPU, against ~$36–57 for the sealed 5-run 8-GPU protocol, and the streaming lane
also needs no materialized checkpoint (saving a 254 GB download or a
materialization pass).

---

## 6. Device matrix

| device | fits | schedule | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1× H200 141 GB (validated) | yes, 3× headroom | slab 288 | 47.08 GB peak measured |
| 1× RTX 6000 Pro 96 GB | yes | slab 288 | ~2–2.5× the decode time (bandwidth-bound) |
| 1× 48 GB (L40S/A6000) | yes | slab 36 + `--ep-emulate 8` | **34.40 GB measured**, bit-identical to slab 288 |
| 128 GB Mac (MPS) | yes | slab 288, `--unpack-device cpu` | see §8 |
| CPU only | ≥32 GB | slab 36 | self-test / fixture only |

---

## 7. Validation ladder — measured results

### L1 offline (no GPU, no large weights) — **PASSED, all five rungs**

`tools/stream_score_selftest.py --packed-root … --fixture …`

| rung | result |
|---|---|
| **L1.a decode parity** | `decode_from_payload(load_payload_cpu(…))` is **bitwise** equal to the reader's `load_decoded_choice(…)` on 12 sampled matrices spanning layers 3–44; the CPU-unpack / device-float split (the MPS path) is **also bitwise** equal |
| **L1.b EP emulation** | `ep_router_remap` matches `transformers.distributed.tensor_parallel.EpRouterParallel.transform_output_post_forward` **exactly** on random routing tables; every `--reduce-order` lands within **0.69 bf16 ULP** of the single-device call (budget 4 ULP) |
| **L1.c forward plumbing** | streaming build vs stock `from_pretrained` on the 0.1B architecturally-complete fixture: **`bitwise_equal: true`, `max_abs_logit_delta: 0.0`**, `missing_keys 0` |
| **L1.d receipt schema** | the emitted `capture-receipt.json` shape is accepted by `quant_pipeline…glm53_logits.load_capture_receipt` |
| **L1.e KLD estimator** | `kld_report._token_kld` vs closed-form fp64 KL: max abs **8.5e-16**; KL(p‖p) exactly **0.0**; the sealed `tokenwise-kld.npy` reshapes to (25, 2047) with per-window means matching the sealed report to **exactly 0.0** |

**L1.c validates forward plumbing on the stated 0.1B fixture.** Its filtered-index
build, slab binding and plain-attribute expert weights reproduce stock
`from_pretrained` bit for bit there, not a whole-model or every-device proof.

### L2 single window on 485591 — **MEASURED**

Window `final-0000`, `--decode-cache none`. Two configurations were run; the
second uses the combine order §7.2 shows is the right model of NCCL.

| quantity | `--ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order sequential` | **`--ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order fp32`** |
|---|---:|---:|
| sealed run-1 window mean KLD | `0.016813833091706077` | `0.016813833091706077` |
| streaming window mean KLD | `0.019810763195244545` | **`0.016828908651190112`** |
| **Δ mean KLD** | `+2.9969e-3` | **`+1.5076e-5`** |
| max abs logit delta vs sealed | 8.375 | **2.000** |
| rms logit delta vs sealed | 0.2797 | **0.0381** |
| argmax agreement vs sealed run-1 | 95.26 % | **99.80 %** (4 of 2047 disagree) |
| top-1 agreement vs teacher | 95.51 % | 95.46 % |
| payload sha256 vs sealed | differs | differs |

**The acceptance rule |Δ mean_kld| ≤ 1e-6 is NOT met at L2.** With the correct
combine model the delta is **1.5e-5**, 15× above the rule — down from 3.0e-3
(3,000×) with a naive bf16 chain.

Structure of the delta under the `sequential` (worst) configuration: the
per-position KLD difference is concentrated at the *start* of the window — the
**top-20 positions of 2047 account for 99.2 % of the mean shift**, and 321
positions are within 1e-4, while the logits differ *everywhere* (median
per-position max-abs delta 1.22, 0 positions below 0.01). That is the signature
of routing flips, not of uniform drift.

### L4 determinism — **PASSED (measured)**

Two independent cold processes (`runs/l2-ep8-seq` cold_run 1 and
`runs/sweep-w0` cold_run 1), same configuration, separate `python` invocations,
separate decode passes:

```
payload sha256 equal: True   (4b29ecefbe7980bf… == 4b29ecefbe7980bf…)
```

The streaming scorer is **bitwise deterministic across cold runs**. Note the
definition: the *tensor payload region* of the safetensors file, not the whole
file — safetensors `__metadata__` carries `cold_run`, so whole-file digests
differ by design in the sealed lane too (the five sealed runs have five distinct
file shas and one identical payload sha). This is the property that lets a
2-cold-run measurement replace the sealed 5-run protocol; `measure_stream`
auto-escalates to 5 runs if it ever fails.

### L3 — runnable by one command, not yet run

```
QP_STREAM_LOCAL_STORE=1 QP_STREAM_CACHE=disk \
QP_STREAM_SWEEP=ep8:reverse,ep8:fp32,ep1:none \
bash /home/jl_fs/glm53-k6/stage_campaign.sh measure_stream
```

The fail-closed path is **validated**: pointing `QP_STREAM_PACKED_ROOT` at a
missing directory bootstraps the runtime, detects the missing `contract.json`,
writes `receipts/stream-verdict.json` with `verdict: INPUT_MISSING` and the
reason, and exits **6** without touching a GPU.

That stage bootstraps (no encoder toolchain needed — it needs neither exllamav3
nor nvcc, so it runs on a container where `stage_campaign.sh setup` cannot complete),
preflights every input and fails closed, stages the payload store locally, runs the L1 ladder, captures
`QP_STREAM_RUNS` (default 2) cold streaming runs, checks cross-run determinism on
the **tensor payload region** (whole-file sha differs by design: `__metadata__`
carries `cold_run`), auto-escalates to 5 cold runs if they differ, produces the
fp64 report through the unmodified `kld_report.py --profile k6-stream`, writes
`receipts/stream-verdict.json`, and sends one ntfy. It publishes nothing.

---

## 7.1 Diagnosis of the L2 delta — mechanically, not by hand-waving

Everything upstream of the combine is proven exact:

1. **Weights.** The BF16 shards at `/home/jl_fs/models/bf16` were re-hashed
   against the sealed inventory (`seal_mode: full-shard-sha256`) — match.
   `config.json` / `index.json` hashes match the sealed inventory. Every routed
   payload passes the reader's three sealed SHA gates on every load, and
   `stored_encoder_closure` re-derives L3/E0/gate_proj and matches the encoder's
   fp16 reconstruction closure.
2. **Surface identity.** `checkpoint_identity_sha256` equals the sealed run's
   `a8668be3…` exactly.
3. **Build.** `missing_keys 0`, and L1.c shows the build is bitwise exact.
4. **Decode.** L1.a shows the decode is bitwise exact.
5. **Routing.** L1.b shows the EP remap matches upstream exactly.
6. **Kernel.** `grouped_mm_experts_forward` confirmed as the sealed dispatch.

What remains is the single op named in §2: the order and precision of the
routed-expert combine. Under EP8 the top-k sum is split across ranks and each
rank's partial is rounded to bf16 *before* being summed; the sealed run then
summed those bf16 partials with NCCL in an order set by the 8-GPU NVSwitch
topology. A single process cannot reproduce that order.

Why an ULP-scale cause produces an O(1) logit delta: **top-8-of-288 routing is a
discontinuous function of the hidden state.** A one-ULP bf16 difference at layer
L flips marginal routing decisions for some tokens at layer L+1, which changes
those tokens' MoE output by an O(1) *relative* amount, which flips more decisions
downstream. Over 42 routed layers this is a chaotic amplification, not a linear
one — which is exactly why the sealed protocol's five cold runs have population
stddev **exactly 0.0** (same node, same NCCL topology, fully deterministic) while
*any* change to the reduction produces a different, equally valid sample.

`--sweep` measures that sensitivity directly on one decode: it re-runs the window
forward under `ep8:sequential`, `ep8:reverse`, `ep8:fp32` and `ep1:none` using
the **same decoded weights**, so the only variable is the combine.

### 7.2 Sweep result — the delta IS the combine order

One decode of all 36,288 matrices, then the same window re-run through the same
weights under different combine orders (`--sweep`). Deltas are against the
`ep8:sequential` primary, on `final-0000`:

One decode of all 36,288 matrices, then the same window re-run through the
**same decoded weights** under four combine variants (`--sweep`). All numbers are
`final-0000` against the sealed EP8 run:

| combine | window mean KLD | **Δ vs sealed** | max abs logit Δ | rms logit Δ | argmax agreement |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **sealed EP8 + NCCL** | `0.016813833091706` | — | 0 | 0 | 100 % |
| **`ep8:fp32`** — partials accumulated in **fp32**, rounded once | `0.016828909` | **+1.508e-5** | **2.000** | **0.0381** | **99.80 %** |
| `ep8:reverse` — bf16 chain, reversed | `0.017404776` | +5.909e-4 | 7.391 | 0.2845 | 94.82 % |
| `ep8:sequential` — bf16 chain, in rank order | `0.019810763` | +2.997e-3 | 8.375 | 0.2797 | 95.26 % |
| `ep1:none` — no EP partition at all | `0.016183480` | −6.304e-4 | 7.672 | 0.2739 | 94.97 % |

Two things fall out of this table, and both are measurements, not inferences.

**(a) The combine order is the whole story, and the amplification is enormous.**
`ep8:sequential` and `ep8:reverse` are the *same arithmetic in a different
order*. They cannot differ by more than one bf16 ULP per layer at the combine.
They diverge by **rms 0.257** in the final logits — the same magnitude as the
worst streaming-vs-sealed gap. The mechanism is amplification through
discontinuity: top-8-of-288 routing is a step function of the hidden state, so a
one-ULP difference at layer L flips marginal routing decisions at layer L+1, each
flip changes that token's MoE output by an O(1) *relative* amount, and 42 routed
layers compound it. This is also why the sealed protocol's five cold runs have
population stddev **exactly 0.0** — same node, same NCCL topology, fully
deterministic — while any change to the reduction lands elsewhere.

**(b) The tested bf16 chains fit the sealed outputs less well than `ep8:fp32`.**
Accumulating the eight per-rank bf16 partials in fp32 and rounding once is
**7× closer in rms, 4× closer in max-abs, and 40–200× closer in mean KLD** than
the tested chains, agreeing on **99.80 %** of argmaxes (4 of 2047 disagree).
This motivates the `--reduce-order fp32` default, but does not uniquely identify
NCCL's internal arithmetic or prove native reduction equivalence.

**The residual.** Under the closest tested combine model, window `final-0000`
lands **1.5e-5** from the sealed mean, still above the 1e-6 acceptance, with
rms 0.0381 in the logits. fp32 summation is **not order-independent** in general;
reduction-order effects have not been eliminated. The proposed
`torch._grouped_mm` slab-view versus standalone layout explanation was tested
in §7.3.

⇒ Under the best available model of the sealed reduction, `|Δ mean_kld| ≤ 1e-6`
is **still not met**, and it is very likely unsatisfiable by construction for any
scorer that does not reproduce the sealed node's exact kernel launches —
including a different 8× H200 box with a different NCCL version or topology. The
sealed number is reproducible *on that machine*; it is not portable across
reduction topologies.

### 7.3 The slab-layout hypothesis is refuted, and the schedule is numerically free

`--slab-experts 36 --ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order fp32` gives every EP group its
own base-aligned 36-expert tensor instead of a view into a 288-expert slab, and
decodes one group at a time:

```
slab-36  payload sha256 : fee81277dba27838f37eb190a5de002d2f4b5a1d086509edbf7fdab97605acc9
slab-288 payload sha256 : fee81277dba27838f37eb190a5de002d2f4b5a1d086509edbf7fdab97605acc9
slab-36 vs slab-288     : BITWISE IDENTICAL   (max abs 0.0, rms 0.0)
peak device memory      : 34.396 GB  (vs 47.08 GB at slab 288)
decode                  : 570.6 s    (vs 397.0 s at slab 288)
```

Two conclusions:

* The `torch._grouped_mm` tiling/alignment hypothesis for the residual is
  **refuted by measurement** — a 36-expert view and a standalone 36-expert
  tensor produce bit-identical output.
* **The tested schedules matched bitwise on this input and lane.** The low-memory
  schedule cost 44 % more decode time. This is not a guarantee for arbitrary
  kernels, hardware, inputs or `--vram-budget-gb` settings.

The residual 1.5e-5 / rms 0.0381 remains unexplained down to bits. The scoped
slab-layout comparison rules out that specific hypothesis, not every reduction
order or kernel difference. It does not identify a causal source or portable
error bound; the K6 bridge is specific to its artifact, panel and lane.

### 7.4 Disclosure language for cards

The measured evidence does **not** support calling the streaming number a
reproduction of the sealed number. Use this instead, filling in the panel mean
from `receipts/stream-verdict.json` once L3 has run:

> Measured with a single-device streaming scorer over the identical sealed
> 25-window / 51,175-position panel, the identical fp64 tokenwise-KL estimator,
> and the identical sealed K6 surface (`checkpoint_identity_sha256`
> `a8668be3592493035e98a52994e0e3c43548a9757eadb79f7ae939f2f32de1c1`, verified
> equal to the sealed run's). Mean tokenwise KLD(teacher‖K6) = ⟨panel mean⟩.
> The sealed 8× H200 EP8 lane measured 0.013723384665701147 on the same panel
> and the same weights. The difference is the routed-expert combine: under
> expert parallelism each rank rounds its partial top-k sum to bf16 and the
> partials are reduced over NCCL, whereas a single device keeps one accumulator.
> Because top-8-of-288 routing is a discontinuous function of the hidden state,
> that ULP-scale difference amplifies over 42 routed layers — measured here by
> re-running one window under several combine orders on identical decoded
> weights, which spread by rms 0.26–0.28 in the logits among themselves. Both
> numbers are valid measurements of the same weights; neither is a defect in the
> other, and the streaming lane is bitwise deterministic across cold runs.

Rules for anyone writing a card from this:

* Do **not** write "reproduces" unless `receipts/stream-verdict.json` says
  `EXACT` or `WITHIN_1E-6`.
* Do **not** quote a Mac number without saying it used a different expert kernel
  (`grouped_mm_fallback`) and therefore cannot be bitwise comparable.
* **Do** quote `checkpoint_identity_sha256` — it is the one hash proving both
  lanes scored the same sealed surface, and it matches exactly.
* **Do** state the combine order used (`--reduce-order`), because it changes the
  number by more than the quantisation effect being measured does.

## 8. Running it on a 128 GB Mac

```bash
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/glm53-stream && . ~/.venvs/glm53-stream/bin/activate
pip install torch "transformers==5.16.1" safetensors numpy accelerate
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/pipeline/src

# raise the Metal wired limit so a 38 GB working set is allowed
sudo sysctl -w iogpu.wired_limit_mb=110000

python tools/stream_score.py \
  --source payload-store --packed-root /path/to/out-k6 \
  --bf16 /path/to/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16 --teacher /path/to/teacher-final \
  --token-panel /path/to/calibration/panel-v1/panel.receipt.json \

  --device mps --unpack-device cpu \
  --ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order sequential \
  --decode-cache none --decode-threads 8 --windows final-0000
```

Notes, stated plainly:

* `--unpack-device cpu` runs `unpack_trellis_states` (pure int64 bit twiddling)
  on the CPU because MPS int64 coverage is partial. **L1.a proves that split is
  bitwise identical to the reader's own decode**, so it is a placement change,
  not a numerical one.
* `_can_use_grouped_mm` is false on MPS and CPU, so the experts run through
  `torch.ops.transformers.grouped_mm_fallback` — same algebra, different kernel.
  A Mac run therefore **cannot** be bitwise equal to a CUDA run, and cannot
  reproduce the sealed `tokenwise_kl` sha. It is independent corroboration, not
  parity. Say so on any card that cites a Mac number.
* The fp64 report on a Mac must use `--device cpu`; measured deviation from the
  `cuda:0` estimator is ~1e-13 tokenwise and ~1e-15 on window means — nine orders
  below the 1e-6 band, so the *number* is comparable even though the *hash* is not.
* You need ~230 GB of free disk for the payload store and ~40 GB of unified
  memory. `--decode-cache disk` needs a further 609 GB.

Offline, with no weights at all:

```bash
python tools/stream_score_selftest.py --only e        # no pipeline checkout needed
python tools/stream_score_selftest.py --packed-root … --fixture … --pipeline-root …
```

---

## 9. Receipts and disclosure

`stream_score.py` writes the same artefact set as the sealed capture:

```
<out>/plan.json              malaiwah.glm53-streaming-student-logit-capture-plan.v1
<out>/reader-identity.json   quant-pipeline.glm53-packed-k6-offline-reader-identity.v1
<out>/backend.json           malaiwah.glm53-streaming-offline-reader-backend.v1
<out>/logits/window-%04d.safetensors   fp32 [2047, 154880], key "logits"
<out>/capture-receipt.json   quant-pipeline.glm53-logit-capture.v1   (SEALED)
```

`capture-receipt.json` is schema-identical to the sealed one — same
`capture_role`, same `student_label` (`uniform-k6`), same ten-key `logit_files`
rows — so `kld_report.py` consumes a streaming run unmodified. Use
`--profile k6-stream`: it keeps the `uniform-k6` label (so the per-run
`kld-report.json` is directly comparable to the sealed one) and takes the
`malaiwah.*` summary branch, because the sealed K6 receipt chain requires a
materialized checkpoint's `materialization-receipt.json` that a payload-store run
legitimately does not have.

Both `backend.json` and `capture-receipt.json` carry a
`streaming_disclosure` block (`malaiwah.glm53-streaming-disclosure.v1`)
enumerating streaming mode, device, dtype policy, EP semantics, reduce order,
experts implementation, and — explicitly — every difference from and every
identity with the sealed path. `backend.json` additionally records the measured
decode/forward seconds, peak memory, the decode-cache budget, the full choice
census hash, and the `combine_order_sweep` rows.

## 10. Reproducing the numbers in this document

Everything above reads the shared filesystem read-only and writes only under
`/home/glm53-stream` (container-local), `$ROOT/receipts/stream-*` and
`$ROOT/logs/stage-stream.state`.

## 12. The BF16 floor lane (`--source native`)

### What it is

`--source {checkpoint,payload-store,dione,nvfp4}` all score a **quantized** routed
surface. `--source native` scores the **un-quantized** one: the 36,288 routed
expert matrices are read straight out of the official BF16 checkpoint by their
released tensor names —

```
model.language_model.layers.<L>.mlp.experts.<E>.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight
```

— the same names `quant_pipeline.campaign.glm53_direct_k4.tensor_name` builds,
i.e. the same tensors the ENCODER read to build the payload store. There is no
codec in the path: no trellis, no MCG codebook, no hash-gated decode. The
tensors are already bf16, so the packed lane's single `fp32 -> bf16` rounding is
the identity and the slab carries the released bytes exactly.

Everything else is the packed lane's own code, unmodified: the same panel, the
same teacher, the same fp64 KLD estimator, the same non-routed view + slab
build, the same `--ep-emulate 8` partition, the same `--reduce-order fp32`
combine, the same `grouped_mm` kernel, the same fp32 logit storage, the same
receipt schema family. **The only difference from a K6/K8 run is where the
expert weights come from**, permitting a descriptive excess-over-control comparison.

### Why it is worth a rental

A quant's panel mean is not its quantization error:

```
excess over control := KLD(teacher || quant on this stack) - KLD(teacher || BF16 on this stack)
```

The historical "floor" is an unquantized cross-stack **control**, not a lower
bound: excess may be negative and KL has no additive causal decomposition.
The common subtraction preserves a raw quant-vs-quant delta algebraically,
not under changes of teacher or lane. See `engines/BF16-FLOOR.md` for the
measured control and descriptive excess values.

### Provenance, without a contract

A native run has no contract, no payload store and no reader ABI to bind, so
the provenance anchor is the **sealed release inventory**
(`quant-pipeline.glm-release-inventory.v1`, passed as `--inventory`, or taken
from `--packed-root/inventory.json`). It must be `seal_mode:
full-shard-sha256`, its `model_revision` must be an immutable 40-hex commit, and
its `config_sha256` / `index_sha256` must bind the local `--bf16` tree — the
same gates the packed lanes apply. Using the K6/K8 encode's own inventory is the
point: it proves the floor and the quants are stated against the same weights.
The receipt records `student_label: native-bf16`,
`capture_role: native_bf16_student`, `bits: null`, `no_decode: true` and a
`native_routed_layout` census of every routed tensor and shard.

Shard *bytes* are not re-hashed by this tool. The inventory's `index_sha256`
binds names and locations, not shard payload contents. Full content integrity
requires the separate `inventory-shards-verified.json` step and its actual
coverage/result; presence or sampled checks do not substitute for it.

### Fail-closed behaviour

* `--source native` and `--profile native-bf16` must be used together; either
  one alone is a hard error, because the profile is what tells
  `kld_report.py` which `student_label` to expect.
* A routed tensor absent from the BF16 index fails before a GPU is touched
  (`routed_tensor_census`), naming the first missing tensor.
* The load report still requires `missing_keys 0 / mismatched_keys 0 /
  error_msgs 0` and refuses if a single NON-routed tensor was left unloaded.
* `kld_report.py --profile native-bf16` expects `capture_role:
  native_bf16_student` and refuses a packed receipt (and vice versa).

### Offline validation — rung L1.f

`stream_score_selftest.py` gained a sixth rung, and it is the one that makes the
floor comparable rather than merely runnable:

> **L1.f native source** — `NativeCheckpointSource` + `fuse_gate_up` rebuild the
> stacked `experts.gate_up_proj` / `experts.down_proj` parameters that
> transformers' own checkpoint-conversion path produces, **bitwise**, on the
> 0.1B architecture fixture.

Measured on the fixture (42→2 routed layers, 8 experts): 16 experts checked,
`bitwise_equal_to_loader_parameters: true`, `max_abs_gate_up_delta` 0.0,
`max_abs_down_delta` 0.0. Two independent code paths land on the same bytes, so
"read the checkpoint experts by name and fuse them" is not a re-interpretation
of the layout — it is the layout.

```bash
$PY $ROOT/tools/stream_score_selftest.py     --packed-root $ROOT/out-k6     --fixture $ROOT/fixture/GLM-5.3-Flash-0.1B-A0.1B     --require a,b,c,d,e,f --pipeline-root $ROOT/pipeline --json /tmp/selftest.json
```

### Reading a new control measurement

Use the current capture/controller instructions rather than the historical
rental filesystem and symlink commands. Keep the reference, panel, capture
lane and estimator configuration matched. From the suite checkout, existing
control/candidate reports can be analyzed without another GPU run:

```bash
bin/fidelity-stats attributable \
    --quant-summary "<candidate-summary.json>" \
    --floor-summary "<native-bf16-summary.json>" \
    --out "<new-excess-over-control.json>"
bin/fidelity-stats paired-delta \
    --report-a "<control-run/kld-report.json>" \
    --report-b "<candidate-run/kld-report.json>" \
    --out "<new-paired-contrast.json>"
```

The unused `bf16_floor_summary.py` producer was retired: it regenerated causal
attribution and residual ratios without the required evidence. Its historical
`BF16-FLOOR.json` remains unchanged. New analyses use the guarded stats command
and source-document qualifications, never overwrite the historical receipt,
and do not claim a causal decomposition or a residual-ratio ranking.

### Default behaviour is unchanged — checked, not asserted

Adding this mode touched shared code (`ExpertStreamer._fill_range`, the receipt
builders). The packed lanes are guarded by `native is None` / `surface is not
None`, and the check that it worked is a K6 packed-store `--dry-run` on the new
tool:

```
checkpoint_identity_sha256 = a8668be3592493035e98a52994e0e3c43548a9757eadb79f7ae939f2f32de1c1   (== sealed)
contract_sha256            = 82483e4b6357c02f4b290c22fad27b6e7f8b78a3edd57463d5185c6ae5f0398a
bits 6 | windows 25 | positions 51,175 | main_routed_policy unchanged
```

What DOES change is `runtime_reader_sha256`, which hashes this file:
`0582ba57…` (the tool K6/K8 ran) → `c1112843…` (the tool with the native mode).
That is by construction and is disclosed rather than papered over. The
identity that binds the *weights* — `checkpoint_identity_sha256` — is
byte-identical, and the RAM-cache guard added in `ensure()` is unreachable on a
`--decode-cache none` run, which is what K6 and K8 used.

### Cost shape — it is an IO problem, not a decode problem

The packed lanes are decode-bound; the native lane has no decode at all and is
purely bound by reading 14.50 GB of routed BF16 per layer, 42 layers per
window, 25 windows. `--decode-cache ram` is therefore worth more here than on
the packed lanes, and it is capped by the container's cgroup, not the host's
RAM. Measured figures are in `engines/BF16-FLOOR.md`.

Measured, 1x H200 spot (IN2, 28 vCPU, 300 GiB cgroup, 200 GB local NVMe),
`--decode-cache ram --decode-threads 28 --ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order fp32`,
BF16 tree on the shared CephFS filesystem:

| stage | measured |
|---|---|
| non-routed model build (1,618 tensors, 47 of 120 shards) + device move | 22.5 s |
| window 1 (cold; all 42 layers filled) | 678.3 s |
| steady-state window | 467-549 s |
| routed BF16 read per layer | 14.50 GB |
| routed BF16 read per cold run | **9.31 TB** (42 layers x window 1, then 25 uncached layers x 24 windows) |
| filesystem read throughput, 28 reader threads | ~1.05 GB/s in the run; 1.44 GB/s measured in isolation |
| RAM decode cache | budget 257.7 GB of the 300 GiB cgroup -> 17 of 42 layers; 408 hits, 625 refusals |
| **peak device memory** | **47.08 GB** - identical to the K6/K8 streaming runs |
| cold run, end to end | **12,514.5 s = 3.48 h** |
| fp64 KLD report, per run | ~90 s |

Two cold runs are therefore ~6.95 GPU-hours. For comparison, on the same box
class and the same panel, the K6 payload-store lane measured 11,018.9 s and
10,488.7 s (5.97 h for two cold runs) and K8 measured 14,254.5 s and 13,755.8 s
(7.78 h). **The floor costs about what one more model costs** — it reads 609 GB
of BF16 per window against K6's 231 GB payload store, and saves the decode.

Two knobs did NOT pay off here and are worth knowing about:

* `--decode-cache ram` is nearly a wash on this box. Its host mirror is
  pageable, so serving a cached layer is a 14.50 GB pageable H2D copy (~11.8 s)
  against ~13.8 s to re-read the layer from the filesystem. It saves ~34 s per
  window on 17 layers and costs ~78 s in window 1 to fill; net ~12 min per run.
  A pinned mirror would make cached layers nearly free and is the obvious next
  optimisation.
* Local NVMe staging is pointless for this lane: the shared filesystem
  delivered ~1.05-1.44 GB/s against the ~900 MB/s previously measured for the
  box's own disk, and the routed set (609 GB) does not fit a 200 GB volume
  anyway.
---

## 13. The NVFP4 community-quant lane (`--source nvfp4`)

### What it is

`--source nvfp4` scores a **third-party NVFP4 snapshot** of GLM-5.3-Flash —
`RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4` and `LibertAIDAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4` today — on
the SAME sealed 25-window panel, against the SAME teacher, with the SAME fp64
estimator and the SAME `--ep-emulate 8 --reduce-order fp32` lane as K6/K8/Dione
and the BF16 floor. The routed expert matrices are decoded from `e2m1` group-16
NVFP4 in exact fp32 on the read-pool CPU threads; from `fuse_gate_up` onward
every line is the packed lane's own code, including its single `fp32 -> bf16`
rounding at slab install. **The only thing that changes is where the expert
weights come from and how they are decoded**, which is what makes the number
land on the same yardstick.

Adapter: `engines/tools/nvfp4_surface.py`. Profile: `--profile nvfp4` (required
together with `--source nvfp4`). Summary family:
`malaiwah.glm53-nvfp4-packed-kld-summary.v1`, student label `nvfp4-e2m1-gs16`.

### The scope finding — measured from the index, never read off a README

The obvious assumption about community quants is that they quantize
everything. **For NVFP4 that is false**, and the surface establishes it from
the artifact's own `model.safetensors.index.json` rather than believing a model
card:

| | RedHatAI @ `36c184c6` | LibertAIDAI @ `357b45cc` |
|---|---|---|
| producer | compressed-tensors 0.17.2.dev32 | modelopt 0.45.0 |
| index tensors | 148,498 | 150,226 |
| main routed (L3-44) | 36,288 modules, NVFP4 | 36,288 modules, NVFP4 |
| MTP layer 45 experts | 864 modules, **FP8 block 128x128** | 864 modules, NVFP4 |
| non-routed | **1,618 tensors, plain BF16, official names** | same 1,618 |
| declared activations | nvfp4 dynamic `local` gs16 (**W4A4**) | `null` (a W4A16 label) |
| activation scales in-repo | `input_global_scale` per module | `input_scale` per module |

Consequences, all enforced rather than assumed:

* The **non-routed view is built from the quant snapshot itself**. Embeddings,
  lm_head, the whole KDA/DSA/MLA path, shared experts, dense MLPs 0-2, vision
  and norms are the artifact's own BF16 bytes, so `--bf16` plays no role —
  passing it is a hard refusal, not a warning.
* The retained-name set must **exactly equal** the official BF16 non-routed
  name set (committed as `nvfp4-evidence/official-nonrouted-names.json`,
  derived from the official index). A single extra or missing name refuses the
  run and names the offender. `nvfp4_surface.py verify-nonrouted --mode full`
  additionally byte-compares those tensors against a local official tree.
* `config.json`'s `quantization_config` is stripped from the *view's* copy of
  the config (never from the source file) so `from_pretrained` builds the
  sealed plain-BF16 model instead of engaging a quantized-loading integration.
* The receipt states this measured scope in `streaming_disclosure.nvfp4.
  scope_policy`, so a registry row can never imply "everything was quantized"
  for this family — or, when a future artifact does quantize more, imply the
  opposite.

### The decode, and how it is proven

The packed stream is one byte per two values, **low nibble first**; bit 3 is
the sign and bits 0-2 index the e2m1 magnitude table
`[0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6]`. Scales are `float8_e4m3fn`, one per 16 elements
**along the input (last) axis**. The two producers spell the global scale
differently and the adapter keeps them apart rather than converting one into
the other (`1/x` then divide would double-round):

```
compressed-tensors:  W = e2m1 * (weight_scale.f32 / weight_global_scale)
modelopt:            W = e2m1 * (weight_scale.f32 * weight_scale_2)
```

Everything is exact in fp32 — every e2m1 value, every f8e4m3 scale and every
fp32 global — so the decode is one divide-or-multiply per group scale and one
multiply per element, with **no float64 anywhere** (that is a hard requirement:
Apple MPS has none, and the selftest proves CPU==MPS bitwise). The f8e4m3 cast
goes through a 256-entry LUT rather than a float8 kernel, for the same reason.

Proven, not asserted: on real ranged-fetched tensors (layer 3, expert 0, both
repos, `gate_proj` and `down_proj`), this decode is **bitwise equal in fp32** to
`compressed_tensors` 0.18.0's own `unpack_fp4_from_uint8` + dequant. The
fixtures and their provenance live in `engines/tools/nvfp4-evidence/`; the selftest
re-derives the reference live whenever the package is importable instead of
trusting the committed copy. Worked numbers from the RedHat tensor:
`weight_global_scale = 17280.0`, `W[0,0..5] = [0.0055555557, -0.0166666675,
-0.0222222228, -0.0333333351, -0.0222222228, -0.0027777778]`.

As a second, independent confirmation the two repos are quantizations of the
same BF16 weights: their decoded L3/E0 `gate_proj` agree at cosine 0.99973
(rel-L2 4.26%) — two teams' quantizers landing on the same tensor.

**Disclosed deviation.** `compressed-tensors`' own `decompress()` unpacks to
bf16 and multiplies in bf16 (max |Δ| 2.8e-4 against exact fp32 on that tensor).
This lane decodes in exact fp32 and rounds ONCE to bf16 at slab install — the
suite's own installation algebra, identical to what the packed lanes do. The
bitwise-equality claim is therefore against the exact math, which is what the
fixtures pin.

### Provenance, without a seal

An NVFP4 snapshot ships no encoder-side receipts and no reconstruction
closures: there is nothing to close against. What the lane records instead:

* the repo id and its **immutable 40-hex revision** (a moving ref is refused);
* `config_sha256` and `index_sha256` of the exact files the run read, re-checked
  in `stream_score` against the tree it loaded;
* a `scope_census_sha256` over the measured scope policy;
* the **per-component sha256** of every packed tensor, scale and global the
  decode consumed, in the installed-choice census — so
  `installed_choice_census_sha256` binds the actual bytes that became weights;
* optionally, whole-shard sha256 verified against the repo's LFS manifest
  fetched from the public HF tree API (`fetch-manifest` then `verify-shards`).
  Without that marker the run refuses unless `--nvfp4-skip-shard-hashes` is
  passed, and the receipt then reads `shard_hash_verification: skipped`.

Every receipt carries `seal_disclosure` stating plainly that the surface was
decoded **without** seal verification. `registry_add` requires that string, the
scope block and the activation block to be present before it will build a row.

### The activation caveat — measured per artifact, not per format

This is a **weights-only** lane. RedHatAI's config declares nvfp4 dynamic
activations (W4A4) and both repos ship per-module activation scale tensors, so
for those two artifacts the measured KLD does **not** capture activation
quantization — the same caveat family as the official FP8 release (`§3` of
[`WHAT-WE-MEASURE.md`](../WHAT-WE-MEASURE.md)). The surface decides which case
it is from the artifact itself and says so three ways: a declared-activations
block copied verbatim, a boolean
`weights_only_decode_captures_artifact_fully`, and a prose `disclosure`. A
genuine W4A16 artifact — no declared input activations, no activation scales in
the index — takes the "captures the artifact fully" branch and earns **no**
caveat it does not deserve. `registry_add` emits the coded disclosure
`activation_quantization_not_captured` only in the first case.

Note LibertAIDAI's disagreement with itself: its config declares
`input_activations: null` (a W4A16 label) while the artifact ships
`input_scale` per module. Both facts are recorded verbatim; the lane does not
adjudicate.

### MTP layer 45

Present, hashed into the artifact identity, **never executed by standard
logits** — unchanged `mtp_policy`. RedHatAI ships it as a separate FP8
block-128x128 group and LibertAIDAI as NVFP4; the census records which, and
`decode_components()` refuses outright if anything ever asks it to decode
layer 45.

### Fail-closed behaviour

* `--source nvfp4` and `--profile nvfp4` must be used together (the profile is
  what tells `kld_report.py` which `student_label` to expect).
* `--bf16` is refused with an explanation, not ignored.
* `--nvfp4-revision` must be an immutable 40-hex commit.
* Every expert tensor in the index must be a KNOWN component of a KNOWN module;
  an unknown component, a stray layer, an out-of-range expert index, an
  incomplete module or a layer that mixes formats each refuse **by name**.
* A main routed layer that is not NVFP4-packed refuses (it is then not an NVFP4
  routed surface, whatever the repo is called).
* A `quant_method` that is neither `compressed-tensors` nor `modelopt`, a
  group size other than 16, non-4-bit or asymmetric/dynamic weights, or a
  config whose GLM5Next geometry differs from the released one, all refuse.
* A NaN f8e4m3 scale code or a zero/NaN global refuses rather than propagating.
* A shard present but missing a tensor fails loudly, naming the tensor; nothing
  in this path can substitute zeros for a missing expert.
* The load report still requires `missing_keys 0 / mismatched_keys 0 /
  error_msgs 0`.

### Offline validation — one command, no GPU, no downloads

`engines/tools/selftest_nvfp4_offline.py` is ten rungs and runs in ~8 s on a laptop;
`bin/selftest_all.sh` runs it. It proves the f8e4m3 LUT against torch's native
cast (254 finite codes, bit patterns, -0.0 included), the nibble order against
compressed-tensors over all 256 byte codes, the dequant known-answers for both
conventions plus a group-axis probe a transposed-scale regression cannot pass,
the real-tensor cross-check above, the full name census over BOTH repos' real
indexes with eight doctored indexes refused by name, surface load and identity
sensitivity with seven malformed snapshots refused, the streaming source end to
end on synthetic shards written under the real shard names, both CLIs reaching
plan-print, and the registry adapter's disclosures and refusals. Two rungs
degrade to a printed SKIP rather than a failure: the live `compressed-tensors`
reference (absent on the CUDA boxes) and the `stream_score --dry-run` rung
(needs a `--pipeline-root` whose `quant_pipeline` imports, i.e. python 3.11+).

```bash
python3 engines/tools/selftest_nvfp4_offline.py --pipeline-root $ROOT/pipeline
```

### Running it

```bash
ROOT=/home/jl_fs/glm53-k6
PY=$ROOT/venv/bin/python
SNAP=/home/glm53-nvfp4/RedHatAI-GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4
REV=36c184c6cda000a481711306df5adde42f63321a

# 0. pin the bytes (public repo, no token), then hash what landed
$PY $ROOT/tools/nvfp4_surface.py fetch-manifest \
    --repo RedHatAI/GLM-5.3-Flash-NVFP4 --revision $REV --root $SNAP

# 1. layout + scope census from config/index alone, no weights read

# 2. orientation audit + non-routed byte compare against the official tree

$PY $ROOT/tools/nvfp4_surface.py probe --root $SNAP --bf16 /home/jl_fs/models/bf16
$PY $ROOT/tools/nvfp4_surface.py verify-nonrouted --root $SNAP \
    --bf16 /home/jl_fs/models/bf16 --mode sample

# 3. plan the scoring run without touching a GPU

    --pipeline-root $ROOT/pipeline --dry-run

# 4. the run itself (drop --dry-run), twice, then the fp64 report
$PY $ROOT/tools/kld_report.py --profile nvfp4 \
    --teacher $ROOT/teacher-final --runs <run1> <run2> \
    --device cuda:0 --out $ROOT/receipts/nvfp4-kld.json
```

The registry row is then built from that summary with an explicit `--lane`
(the family name carries no lane marker, so the tool refuses to infer one) and
`--third-party-artifact` (the weights are not ours).

### Cost shape — expected, not yet measured

**No paid NVFP4 measurement has been run.** What the layout says up front: the
routed read is **4.08 GB per layer** (14.16 MB per expert x 288) against the
BF16 floor lane's 14.50 GB, so this lane reads ~3.6x less than the floor and
~1.5x less than the K6 payload store per layer, and adds a decode that is a LUT
gather plus one multiply — far cheaper than the trellis decode the packed lanes
run. Peak device memory is the packed lanes' (the slab shape is unchanged, and
`NONROUTED_BYTES` still holds because the decoded view is same-shape bf16).
Whether the lane ends up IO-bound or decode-bound on a given box is a
measurement, not a prediction, and the receipt records both counters
(`nvfp4_payload_bytes_read`, `nvfp4_shards_read`) so the first real run answers
it.

## 14. The GGUF community-quant lane (`--source gguf`)

### What it is, and how it differs from every other source

`--source gguf` scores a community **llama.cpp GGUF** of GLM-5.3-Flash
(unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF and friends) on this same sealed panel, through
this same single-device capture, so the number lands on the same yardstick as
K6/K8/Dione/native-BF16.

It differs from every other source in **scope**, and that difference is the
whole point of reading this section. `--source {checkpoint,payload-store,
dione,native}` all quantize (or not) the **routed experts only**, and run the
official BF16 non-routed parameters untouched. A GGUF quantizes everything:

| tensor group | K6 / K8 / Dione / native | GGUF (unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL) |
|---|---|---|
| routed experts (42 x 288 x 3) | the artifact | the artifact (Q4_K / Q5_K / Q6_K) |
| `token_embd`, `output` (lm_head) | official BF16 | **the artifact** (Q8_0) |
| attention / KDA / DSA / indexer | official BF16 | **the artifact** (Q8_0) |
| shared experts, dense MLPs (L0-2) | official BF16 | **the artifact** |
| norms, conv1d, router gates | official BF16 | the artifact, stored F32 |
| vision tower | official BF16 | **not in the artifact** (separate mmproj) |

So the lane materializes a **decoded non-routed view**: every non-routed
tensor is dequantized once into safetensors under the official HF names,
shapes and dtypes, and the sealed `from_pretrained` runs over that directory
unmodified (`build_streaming_model(nonrouted_view=...)`). The loader
assertions are the same ones the BF16 view gets: `missing_keys 0 /
mismatched_keys 0 / error_msgs 0`, and every unexpected key must be a streamed
routed expert. The view is fingerprinted by the artifact identity plus the
adapter's own hash and reused across cold runs — it costs a one-time **~19 GB**
write to `--work-dir` (the same 1,618 tensors the BF16 view symlinks) and a
decode pass, after which cold runs 2 and 3 reuse it. The receipt records
`reused`, the per-source counts (decoded / float32-passthrough / MLA-
reconstructed / vision-copied) and a value spot-check against a fresh decode.

`--bf16` is still required, but its role narrows to config/tokenizer files,
the release-inventory binding, and the vision tower — which the text-only
panel never executes. The receipt says so.

### Decode

`engines/tools/gguf_surface.py` implements F32, F16, BF16, Q8_0, Q4_K, Q5_K and
Q6_K as plain PyTorch (uint8-level unpack, fp32 accumulation, no float64, no
int64 beyond gather indices — so it runs on CUDA, MPS and CPU under the
suite's device policy). Every kernel is **bitwise equal to gguf-py 0.19.0's
reference `dequantize`** on real ranged-fetched bytes of the live artifact,
and the offline selftest re-proves it from committed fixtures, plus a scalar
transliteration of llama.cpp's own `get_scale_min_k4` for the Q4_K/Q5_K
sub-block scales.

Any other ggml type is **refused by name and type at census time**, before a
byte is decoded. That is a named exclusion, not a silent skip.

Which of unsloth's twelve builds that actually buys, measured from each
build's own tensor table (`gguf-evidence/unsloth-build-census.json`, all
1,412 tensors per build, revision `2975ab41`) — **do not read this off the
directory name**, because unsloth's "Dynamic" recipe mixes IQ types into
builds whose names say K-quant:

| build | ggml types present | v1 |
|---|---|---|
| `BF16` | BF16, F32 | **scores** (and would be this lane's own GGUF floor) |
| `Q8_0` | Q8_0, F32 | **scores** |
| `UD-Q4_K_XL` | Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0, F32 | **scores** |
| `UD-Q5_K_XL` | Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0, F32 | **scores** |
| `UD-Q6_K_XL` | Q6_K, Q8_0, F32 | **scores** |
| `UD-Q3_K_XL` | + IQ3_XXS, IQ4_XS, **Q3_K** | refused |
| `UD-Q2_K_XL` | + IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS, IQ4_XS, **Q2_K**, Q3_K | refused |
| `UD-IQ4_XS`, `UD-IQ3_XXS`, `UD-IQ2_XXS`, `UD-IQ1_S`, `UD-IQ1_M` | IQ1_S/M, IQ2_S/XS/XXS, IQ3_S/XXS, IQ4_XS, Q2_K, Q3_K | refused |

So the IQ kernels — not Q2_K/Q3_K — are the real gate on the low-bpw half of
the repo: adding Q2_K and Q3_K alone unlocks nothing, because every build that
needs them needs IQ types too. `ddh0`'s single-file 3.86 bpw build
(IQ3_S/IQ4_XS) is refused for the same reason, though its *names* all map — its
convert vintage spells the arch `glm5-next` and the indexer tensors
`indexer.kpool_*`, and both spellings are covered.

### The name map, and the one genuinely dangerous tensor

llama.cpp's `glm5next` names are mapped back to HF names and the map is
**bijected against the official BF16 index**, not spot-checked: all 1,412 GGUF
tensors are consumed (1,259 one-to-one + 129 fused expert tensors + 24 MLA
halves) and the resulting 1,271 official names exactly equal the official
38,770 minus the 37,152 routed minus the 347 vision. An unmapped tensor is an
error naming it.

The dangerous one is `kv_b_proj`. It does not exist in the GGUF: llama.cpp
stores the MLA projection pre-split as `attn_k_b` (dims `[256,512,64]` —
per-head **transposed**) and `attn_v_b` (`[512,256,64]`). The reconstruction
is, per head `h`: rows `[h*512 .. h*512+255]` are `transpose(k_b[h])`, rows
`[h*512+256 .. h*512+511]` are `v_b[h]`. This was settled numerically, not by
reading the C: `audit_mla_placement` scores all four candidate arrangements
against the official BF16 tensor and the shipped one wins with rel-L2
**0.0054** (the Q8_0 quantization error) against **1.40** for every
alternative.

Note the audit's pass criterion is **rel-L2, not a cosine margin**: two
arrangements that share a leading block have a cosine gap that shrinks as
`1/(2*heads)` — measured 0.013 over the full 64 heads but 0.546 over a 2-head
window — while rel-L2 does not move with window size.

The routed experts get the same treatment. The fused tensor is
`[in, out, 288]` and slot `e` is *assumed* to be HF expert `e` — an assumption
as unproven-by-inspection as the kv_b layout was, and as silently wrong if it
is off, because a permuted expert order decodes cleanly and closes every
census. `audit_expert_placement` (CLI: `gguf_surface.py audit-expert`) settles
it numerically: slot 0 of `blk.3.ffn_gate_exps.weight` reproduces the official
`layers.3.mlp.experts.0.gate_proj.weight` at rel-L2 **0.0714** (the Q4_K error)
while every row-shifted control sits at **1.42**. The same test simultaneously
proves the reversed-dims orientation and the projection mapping — a transposed
read or the wrong projection fails it.

### Provenance and disclosure

A community GGUF ships no encoder receipts, no reconstruction closures and no
sealed reader ABI, so the anchors are the immutable repo revision and a
whole-file sha256 of every consumed `.gguf`:

```bash
# once per artifact: hash the files, write gguf-files-verified.json
python3 engines/tools/gguf_surface.py verify-files \
  --file .../GLM-5.3-Flash-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00006.gguf ...   # all six
```

Without that marker a measurement refuses; `--skip-gguf-hashes` is a
**disclosed** unverified read that lands in the receipt as
`gguf_file_hash_verification: skipped` and becomes an `artifact_files_unhashed`
caveat on the registry row.

The receipt carries `student_label: gguf-llamacpp`, `capture_role:
gguf_student`, `bits: null`, the file list, the measured ggml type census, the
quantizer's own metadata (including unsloth's imatrix keys), a
`seal_disclosure`, and a `scope_policy` block **measured from the artifact's
own tensor table** — which tensors carry a quantized ggml type — never
asserted from the format's name. `kld_report.py --profile gguf` lifts all of
it into `malaiwah.glm53-gguf-packed-kld-summary.v1`, and `registry_add.py`
turns it into `unsealed_source` + `quantization_scope_whole_model` disclosures.
A GGUF summary without `gguf_files` or without `scope_policy` is refused, not
recorded.

### Running it

```bash

```

### Fail-closed behaviour

* `--source gguf` and `--profile gguf` must be used together.
* `--gguf-revision` must be an immutable 40-hex commit; there is no "main".
* Every part of a llama.cpp split must be passed; `split.count` /
  `split.tensors.count` are checked against the union tensor table.
* The geometry gate reads the artifact's OWN `glm5next.*` KVs (46 blocks, 288
  experts, 8 used, 3 dense, 4096 hidden, 2048 moe, 154880 vocab, 1 nextn).
  Both observed arch spellings (`glm5next`, `glm5-next`) are accepted and
  recorded verbatim.
* An https `--gguf-file` is metadata/audit-only: a real capture refuses it.
* The view's dtypes are checked against the official tree's ACTUAL safetensors
  headers wherever those shards are present, so the view stays dtype-identical
  to a native build rather than trusting a hardcoded suffix list.

### Offline validation

`python3 engines/tools/selftest_gguf_offline.py` — nine rungs, no GPU, no network,
~2 s, wired into `bin/selftest_all.sh`. It proves reference equality against
gguf-py, the independent scalar scale unpack, the split container plus eight
named refusals, the real-metadata census and bijection, the MLA audit and the
expert-slot audit on real bytes, the expert slice and materialized view, and
the `dry-run` plan print.
Pass `--pipeline-root` to add the `stream_score.py --source gguf --dry-run`
rung. Evidence fixtures live in `engines/tools/gguf-evidence/`.

**Not yet measured.** Everything above is built and validated without a GPU;
no GGUF panel number exists yet. The first capture is a rental.
## 15. The MLX community-quant lane (`--source mlx`)

Documented in full in [tools/MLX-SURFACE.md](tools/MLX-SURFACE.md) rather than
here, because the MLX lane's distinguishing facts are all about the ARTIFACT
(what an Apple-silicon conversion quantizes and what it leaves at source dtype)
rather than about the streaming lane, which it uses unchanged.

The one thing worth repeating here: **scope is censused per artifact, never
inferred from the format.** The three community lanes do not share a scope.
`--source nvfp4` (section 13) quantizes the routed experts only, exactly like
K6/K8. `--source gguf` (section 14) quantizes everything including `token_embd`
and `output`. `--source mlx` sits between them: routed experts, dense MLPs,
shared experts and four DSA attention projections are quantized, while
embeddings, `lm_head`, the whole KDA attention path and the vision tower pass
through at source dtype. Each receipt carries its own measured census, and
`registry_add.py` refuses a summary that arrives without one.

## 16. Constraints honoured

* No HF or GitHub token appears in any code path, argument or log.
* Nothing is published; `measure_stream` has no upload step and writes no
  done-marker.
* Sealed receipts are opened read-only; comparisons hash in place.
* `out-k8` is never read or written; machines 485565 / 485586 / 485016 are
  untouched. The streaming stage writes its state to
  `logs/stage-stream.state` (via `QP_STAGE_STATE`) so the K8 supervisor's
  `logs/stage.state` is never clobbered.
* Bulk output goes to container-local disk, never to the shared `/home/jl_fs`.

---

**2026-08-29 addendum.** The tooling grew around this sealed doc without
changing the lane: `stream_score.py --capture-role teacher` can now emit this
lane's own SAME-LANE teacher (which drives the lane's 0.011506 floor to an
exact, hash-evidenced zero — recipe and ladder in
[`SAME-LANE-TEACHER.md`](SAME-LANE-TEACHER.md)); `--store-positions
per-window:<m>` produces position-sampled PREVIEW captures no sealed consumer
accepts (score them with `bin/kld-preview`); and the streaming/local lanes are
now pinned in `bin/engines.json` against this file's real CLI. Default
invocations are byte-identical to the sealed behaviour (ladder rung L1.j
proves the receipt shape is unchanged).

---

## 2026-09-07 evidence qualification

All historical run receipts and numbers above are retained. Reference-forward
fidelity is not native-serving qualification. In
[`tools/layer-outer-evidence/exl3-decoder-parity-vs-exllamav3.json`](tools/layer-outer-evidence/exl3-decoder-parity-vs-exllamav3.json),
the 2026-09-06 comparison of 15 modules reports `all_bitwise=false` and
`all_bitwise_pre_hadamard=true`: matching unpack/LUT values precedes differing
full reconstruction rounding (native fp16 stages versus reference fp32).
The native reconstruction caveat cannot be retired on pre-Hadamard parity.
No surface reconstruction math or historical metric is changed by this correction.

### Native observation continuation

`tools/exl3_decoder_parity_vs_exllamav3.py` now writes a new v2 observation,
not a replacement for the frozen v1 evidence above. Its stages are distinct:
verified native implementation, pre-Hadamard values, full reconstructed weights,
and native module forward. Every declared module and forward case is required;
empty, duplicate, skipped or partial coverage cannot qualify. Comparisons require
matching geometry/dtype, finite nonempty tensors and byte equality, including
signed zero.

On an **authorized supported CUDA host**, with the pinned wheel's matching Torch
stack in an isolated environment, the command is:

```bash
python engines/tools/exl3_decoder_parity_vs_exllamav3.py \
  --install --device cuda:0 \
  --cache-dir /path/to/scratch/exl3-cache \
  --out /path/to/new-native-observation.json
```

`--install` verifies the release wheel digest, forcibly installs it without
dependency upgrades, then verifies the installed implementation bytes. A matching
version string alone cannot qualify the named reference. The forward cases invoke
the real `LinearEXL3.forward`; branch labels follow the pinned dispatch predicates,
not a CUDA execution trace. The primary output reference uses the unchanged
reconstructed weights; the native-weight dense comparison is diagnostic only.
Native weight bytes are retained for both the isolated diagnostic window and
the corresponding slice of the full reconstruction, with dtype, shape, byte
order and content digest. This permits offline mismatch diagnosis; those saved
windows are not artifact-wide evidence.
Neither result qualifies whole-model logits, generation, cache behavior or serving.

An existing output or the canonical v1 destination is refused. A complete strict
JSON observation is published exclusively and atomically; serialization failure
cannot leave a partial observation. Ranged downloads reject an ignored/mismatched
range before reading its body and validate bounded tensor geometry. `--fetch-only`
populates its cache but writes no native observation.

No new CUDA qualification was performed for this continuation. The offline
producer selftest is a synthetic CPU error-boundary test, not a native oracle.
`tools/selftest_exl3hf_offline.py --require-live-native` requires execution of the
live oracle rather than accepting its absence as a skip; it does **not** turn
pre-Hadamard replay into full reconstruction or forward qualification. The
comparator accepts the reviewed v1 evidence only with its exact receipt digest
and matching current decoder source bytes; `weights_reconstructed` remains.

### Live CUDA continuation

The subsequent Lambda A10 / Torch 2.11 CUDA 12.8 run is retained under
[`native-cuda-2026-09-07`](tools/layer-outer-evidence/native-cuda-2026-09-07/native-repeat-check.json).
Both complete observations are present, not just their aggregate verdict.
`native_export_reference` independently decodes the inputs and reproduces the
native export's four fp16 rounding points. It matches all 15 full reconstructed
matrices bitwise on that runtime. It shares the general-purpose PyTorch fp32
CUDA matrix-multiply backend; this is not independent verification of BLAS.
Two fresh processes reproduce all full native reconstruction hashes and all
60 corresponding native-forward cases exactly.

The historical comparisons still fail: native export is not the unchanged
fp32 decoder, and native direct/unfused/fused forward programs are not a CPU
fp64 dense matmul. No tolerance was loosened and no historical primary failure
was overwritten. Outer dispatch labels remain predicate observations, not proof
of the exact inner GEMV/int8/MMA kernel. `weights_reconstructed` remains, and
neither export equality nor sampled repeatability qualifies a whole model.

The separate complete-model investigation is documented in
[`port/README.md`](../port/README.md). It found a native recurrent-state
repeatability defect that immediate output-only checks missed, and qualifies
an explicitly changed ordered CUDA backend under a separate runtime identity.
That finding does not alter these historical reconstruction comparisons.

The hidden-replay staging evidence separately records 98,878 present/nonempty
files, but `hidden-replay-evidence/packed-content-verify.txt` hashes only
400/61,711 objects (1,277,972,480 bytes) with zero mismatches, and
`hidden-replay-evidence/stage-timing.txt` records verification `rc=1`.
These are presence and sampled-integrity evidence, not full passing verification.
