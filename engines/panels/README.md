# Panels built by this suite

A panel is a *yardstick*, and a yardstick belongs to the model family it was
built for. `engines/tools/hf_capture.py` consumes the upstream
`quant-pipeline.glm53-token-panel.v1` layout (`panel.json` + `arrays/`), and
every panel we had in that layout was built for GLM-5.3-Flash by somebody
else's pipeline. Reusing one against a different model is the cross-model
comparison our own rules forbid: the token ids may be numerically valid, but
the panel was selected for another model's corpus and another model's
calibration separation, and a number measured on it invites being ranked
against numbers it has no business being ranked against.

So a model family that needs its own yardstick gets its own panel, with its
own `panel_id`, built by `engines/tools/build_token_panel.py` — a rule anyone can
re-run, with no RNG anywhere in it.

| panel_id | model family | shape | corpus |
|---|---|---|---|
| `panel--minimaxm3.malaiwah.corpus5x5` | `minimax_m3_vl` (vocab 200,064) | 5 strata x 5 windows, 2048 ctx, 2047 scored -> **51,175 positions** | `malaiwah/qwen38-27b-fidelity-suite-v5` @ `7797fcce`, `corpus/text/` |
| `panel--glm53.malaiwah.corpus5x5-v1` | `glm_moe_dsa` (full GLM-5.3, vocab 154,820) | 5 strata x 5 windows, 2048 ctx, 2047 scored -> **51,175 positions** | `malaiwah/qwen38-27b-fidelity-suite-v5` @ `7797fcce`, `corpus/text/` |
| `panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25` (directory `panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25/`) | `glm5_next` (GLM-5.3-Flash, vocab 154,856) | 25 `final` windows of 665, 2048 ctx, 2047 scored -> **51,175 positions** | **transported, not built**: `brandonmusic/GLM-5.3-Flash-BF16-Teacher-Logits` @ `95f4fdd9`, `calibration/panel-v1/` (669 files, byte-verified against the Hub listing by `engines/tools/transport_token_panel.py`; provenance in the sibling `.provenance.json`). Its `panel.json` carries no `panel_id`, so a dataset captured on it names the panel `panel-artifact-sha256:6bafe3283c54…`, which is the registry row's `identity.panel_token_sha256` -- the same panel. Same-lane roots on it form a NEW comparability group beside the older rows measured against brandonmusic's teacher logits; they do not upgrade those rows. |

The MiniMax panel deliberately matches the **shape** of
`panel--glm53.brandonmusic.final25` (25 x 2047 = 51,175 scored positions).
Equal shape does not imply equal statistical power: variance, effect size,
document heterogeneity and token dependence differ. The panels are not
interchangeable. Shared comparability keys are necessary, not sufficient:
the registry pair predicate must also admit any ranked comparison.

## Reproducing

Every panel here is rebuildable from its own `panel.receipt.json`, which
records the corpus repository AND revision, the per-document sha256, the
tokenizer file digests, and the selection rule in full. Rebuild and compare
`suite_token_hash_sha256`.

## What the builder does NOT check

`separation.checked` is `false` and says so in the receipt: this tool runs no
lexical or n-gram scan against a quantizer's calibration corpus. Panel /
calibration separation is a DECLARATION, not a verified property, and any
measurement whose artifact was calibrated on overlapping text must carry that
as a disclosure rather than relying on the panel to have excluded it.
